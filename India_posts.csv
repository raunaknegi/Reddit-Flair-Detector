nlj3fm,"So, unfortunately I recently watched Sudarshan News for some time and OMG he is very provocative and is almost on the verge of literally branding all Muslims as dangerous in his prime time show.

I want to ask a question to all my fellow Muslim brothers and sisters why don't to pursue legal action against him. He is using some examples of bad Muslims and twisting it to brand all of you in bad light. Right now the Central government is in defensive mode and the opposition is also quite active. If you do this you will surely get support from a lot of people who are being targeted and as the western media is always critical of India no matter who is in power they will show this with great enthusiasm and this might put diplomatic pressure on the government to do something as I am sure this Sudarshan guy is working for the government.

I am afraid that if this continues he will actually motivate some people to do violent acts.

P.S. - ignore bad english if any.

Thank you.",Legal case against Sudarshan News?,Politics,

I guess I'm lucky, lol.

Have you tried referring them to a marriage counselor? It may help. It's not at all normal if they are not even smiling at each other. And if it's affecting your mental health, have a peaceful discussion with both of them and confess that it's not right to live like this. Every marriage has some issues. No couple is perfect. But Imperfection also have some limits and if they are crossing those limits, consulting a marriage counselor will be better. Of course. Extremely stupid must say. First of all, it is not common.

Yes I am a hypocrite, and partly its on me too. I am 27 and haven't voted even once. I had a disdain for the world of politics, brushed it aside. So Idk even if I have any rights to do this rant. I will do it the next time though.

Accepting any authority is totally detrimental to spirituality, because authority implies that someone has been placed in a position of acceptance. 

We are accustomed to authority, which we think will lead us to spirituality. We think and hope that another can, by his extraordinary powers, transport us to this realm of eternal freedom which is happiness. Your whole outlook on life is based on that authority.

Anyone who accepts any truth from someone else has not yet found it within himself. As long as people are unwilling or for any reason unable to find truth within themselves there will be no possibility of obtaining any true spiritual insight.

Kejriwal!I know he had made some weird statements,But he works great on floor.Another good part about him is that he holds regular press conferences,That brings more transparency unlike godi government. Crazy conspiracy theory - Congress + BJP are hand in glove and together decide who gets to rule and for how long. Every few decades when X party loses and Y wins, people think that it is their victory - to uproot X party and give power to Y party but in reality all these parties are made of super-elites (cunning power hungry people) who are never interested in ground work and up-liftment of people; but rather in acquiring more power and money. After every few terms, these parties rotate shifts (i.e. win or lose after mutual agreement) to keep the facade of democracy going and to keep people from revolting and burning the entire system down.

We need much better class of leaders. Independents. Its high time people actually put effort in choosing the right candidates rather than voting for political parties which have failed for a long time."
nlfsgw,"Got vaccinated at last after huge struggle. I have been trying to source a shot for myself from various sources. I feel a lot of us are privileged enough to go and get a shot even if its paid. So this post is for all of us who can afford to put in some money and **EFFORT**. Effort in bolds because it's been a pain in ass to get a slot booked for the past 1 week.

I live in the outskirts of Chennai near Mahabalipuram and I found literally no hospitals in my area and district (As Mahabalipuram is part of Chengalpet district). Every day for the past one week, my daily routine includes to hit on Cowin app three times a day (Had I taken my meds this regularly, I would have had better immunity now). Still I used to find no hospitals providing vaccination for 18+ folks.

By this time Tamil Nadu was going into very stringent lockdowns banning inter district travels and other restrictions. Doubt started creeping in me that I won't be getting a dose by end of May. A couple of my acquaintances had got vaccinations from Chennai, and they said they had got ePass for the same.

So from Monday I sat in front of Cowin again to check for slot availability. Damn it was one pain in ass as whenever I login I find all the slots booked. I started checking it so frequently that I haven't even checked my DMs after a risky text to my crush. 

On Tuesday, I had to get milk and did a Paytm payment that's when I noticed there was a feature to notify me when slots were available, and I was like damn didn't know such a thing existed. Immediately I had enabled notifications for the same for all the nearby districts. This is where my vaccination story actually starts. I started receiving notifications for the availability of slots almost like in an hour. But by the time I login to Cowin using OTP (which takes a minute usually) the slots become unavailable. This happened a lot and almost frustrated by the lack of vaccines (which is another story of its own) I was almost giving up on my vaccine hunt. Then at night post dinner I was watching something online, and I got a notification for availability at Apollo hospital, but this was a different branch which was way too far away from my place. And I was like chuck it lets book it, and I was in the slot time booking page entered the captcha, awaiting it to load, and suddenly I get a message that this was also booked.

My patience was on thin ice as this was the closest I got the whole week to book a slot. I knew I had given up. I knew I won't be getting my shot anytime soon just pressed refresh and bam I got to see a slot at another Apollo near my place (45kms relatively close xD) and without any hesitation clicked on it. I didn't even check the timings just clicked whatever I saw first entered the captcha and yaaaayyy!! got my first vaccination slot booking done successfully.

The next part of my story will be done so quick as it had no pain (except while the nurse who was kind enough to say it will be just an ant bite and inserted the needle into my shoulders) but yeah, booked the ePass through the online portal. Got printouts of all the documents i.e. ePass and the vaccine appointment registration (which is not necessary) and went to bed early as it's a 1hr drive from my place.

This morning woke up all excited like a 9-year-old kid, had breakfast took my car and got on roads after a long time. Damn that was the best part of the entire story. The ECR drive and the breeze was amazing. Reached the vaccination centre well before time and waited at the entrance. On my way there were a couple of checkpoints. The police even though tired but had their chests and chins up so high brave men and women. When I told them I am going for vaccination they didn't even ask a single thing post that just smiled and asked me to move on. Thanked them with a smile but wanted to hug them (mental hugs if that's a thing) as they are standing under the sun and protecting us from this invisible demon. Least I could do is get vaccinated and break the chain, so felt proud as I drove past them.

Entered the Apollo hospital on time, enquired about the vaccination centre and walked there to be greeted by young doctors with a smile again. (Damn lot of people are being nice). Greeted them, filled in the application form, waited for a while till they called out my name. Gave the nurse the form and the secret code (Not nuclear launch code or password to get into my account) and she took out the injection and said those golden lines and done. Asked me to wait for a while at the centre, so I was hanging out there for like 30 mins, and took off.

I am writing this after a good wholesome lunch and a nap. Feeling fresh and a bit pricking pain on my left shoulder (where the vaccine was administered). But I can type so no complaints.

**If you are here then I would please request all of you to get vaccinated ASAP. Use any tools that works for you, not just the one I mentioned. Book your slots at any hospital that you get do not hesitate for even a second as people do book the slots as soon as they get it. And do not worry if its COVISHIELD or COVAXIN book anything that you can get. Because at the end of the day, you will be saving a lot of lives without your knowledge.**",I got vaccinated!!,Coronavirus," * [Covid-19 Megathread for Discussions is live here>>](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/n1plmu/coronavirus_covid19_discussion_megathread_9/)

nle2dz,"First of all, the number of unverified links on this sub is crazy. The bots that alert people of vaccination slots is one thing, but those that automate the process of getting a slot on Cowin...I mean, congrats on being so smart Mr. Techie, but you're ensuring that only a small section of people can get the vaccine. I read a comment somewhere that said ""lol it's just bot vs bot now"". I'm lucky I got my first jab, but sitting with my helpers every day trying desperately to get them slots and then coming here and reading this bullshit is so infuriating. Typical Indian mentality. Shame on you.","If you're making or using bots to cheat the system, congrats, you're part of the problem",Coronavirus," Having enough vaccine is the simplest solution.

Bots aren’t getting jabbed. People are. People will do the best they could to save their and their loved one's life. The system should create captcha which cannot not be beaten You can't stop people for making bots, people with more than 4 brain cells are desperate for vaccines, if people are desperate they will go to any limits as seen with oxygen and drugs blackmarketing. 

And then there are people who are so vaccine hesitant that they will jump in a river to escape from vaccines. 

Incredible India Maybe I don't understand tech so well, but if I'm not wrong, these bots can be used by you too? I'm not sure why someone trying to help his or her fellow citizens should feel guilty about it. 

Also these bots only send you a notification if your age group and your area are allowed, correct? So again not sure, how this is cheating the system. Also it's not like the same person is going time and again to get vaccinated (i.e, after their two shots)

I'm not sure if I understand your argument. This is so stupid argument. Government not having sufficient resources is problem. It’s not that people are stocking/hoarding up vaccines. Extending this argument you can say people who have access to smart phones are also part of the problem as many people don't have smart phones..so everyone should break their smart phones🤦‍♂️         
Main problem is that there is a shortage of vaccines and the policy makers haven't thought about people who don't have access to technology. Stop blaming the techies. Government creating lottery system during pandemic is not a problem but people trying to have better odds is problematic. Wah bhai wah Bots are an easy scapegoat. I booked using the app after getting alerted by a bot. When there is scarcity people will use every advantage they can get.
What do you mean you and your ""helpers"" trying to book a slot. You can afford to get helpers to book the slots for you, those who can setup a bot will use that.
Are you concerned that people who cannot afford helpers can use their knowledge to get an advantage.
Do you still realise you are among the privileged ones who can effectively use the site or app (with or without bot) to book a slot for vaccination.

Your concern is specific to people who have an advantage over you, also take a moment to think about those who are less privileged. Not using a bot isn't enough for them to get the vaccine. There should be an alternative for those who are not technically inclined.

There is no point in fighting bots when that does not lead to a solution. When there are enough vaccines it wouldn't  matter if I use a bot or walk in to the hospital to get the vaccine. Agreed."

Hotstar VIP is basically useless. I had gotten subscription via vodafone recharge and you can't watch any English movie in original audio, only option is dubbed version. Also the ads are so freaking long! Premium is worth it though, not as expensive as Netflix and much better content. You are paying 400 for a year for complete access to all hindi content and all sports, that includes ISL, PL, almost all of Indian cricket. All that in 33rs/month. They have to earn via different means to keep the platform floating. And there's no false advertising, they say upfront what you get with the VIP service and they give you that. It's because subscription is super cheap. Ads are subsidizing the price of this Hotstar sub. Netflix, is 800 pm and no ads. Amazon has endless pit of money, so they can afford to give it for 1k for decades before increasing the price. Hotstar has IPL, which I'm sure costs shit tons to support.

Like seriously, they edited the certificate again after issuing it initially to just add his face....the priorities of this government is so fucked up. It's so hard to get vaccinated in this that I want my own photo on the certificate because it's an accomplishment which required a lot of dedication . Low-key/s Careful.

However, because of an administrative screw-up, there is no certificate. The official app shows that he hasn't even been scheduled for his 1st vaccine. Will the certificate still remain valid?"

UP the butt hole of hell. X men: Origins If this becomes news - Instead of acknowledging and fixing problem. We will get a twitter BJP PR saying this is ok, and we can cross-vaccinate, with some fake organisational support /s. Actually mixing 2 vaccines is not the worst idea and is already taking place in a lot of countries. In Europe , US, and Canada lot of people, specially young ones got AstraZaneca before we found out about the blood clot side effects. They were all given Pfizer or Moderna as the second dose. There was also multiple reports published about this, like the one below:

[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/05/05/993882203/giving-2-doses-of-different-covid-19-vaccine-could-boost-immune-response?t=1622041165378](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/05/05/993882203/giving-2-doses-of-different-covid-19-vaccine-could-boost-immune-response?t=1622041165378)

The only problem here is Covaxin still does not have peer reviewed credible data. Also both Covaxin and Covishield are vaccines developed using older technologies and the AZ and Pfizer/Moderna mix is one vaccine with older tech and the other which is a RNA vaccine.

What has happened in UP could actually be used as a huge scientific study as to how these 2 vaccines interacted and what effects they had. They are being treated like guinea pigs by government."

nlceid,"For all the buzz, most people I've spoken with including myself seem relatively in the dark on what exactly is happening with the new Guidlines. Below is what \*I THINK\* I've understood so far, this is purely educational and in-case of misinformation please know that was not my purpose. I'm only trying to understand. SO:

&#x200B;

• Social media platforms, under legally valid situations should actively provide user data from any of the social media apps if the demand is legal.  

• Companies should appoint a special grievance redressal officer, who will be responsible for addressing user issues.

• If not complied, the respective platform loses intermediary status i.e the platform becomes liable for ALL user actions / posts, which for obvious reasons would be not optimal for a social media company.

• Whatsapp specifically was asked to trace user messages, making E2e encryption pointless and causing a rather significant breach of user privacy.

• Due to this Whatsapp has now filed a lawsuit against the Govt as a;  'violation of privacy rights in India's constitution since it requires social media companies to identify the ""first originator of information"" when authorities demand it'

&#x200B;

Now on paper these things feel weird and autocratic but I feel I don't fully understand the scale of these changes. People already are under the assumption that almost all Social Media platforms are essentially harvesting stations for user data and digital privacy feels like nothing but smoke and mirrors. The only blatantly significant change here is making Whatsapp circumvent the whole basis of it's platform, E2e encryption.

Can't tell if I'm missing something or just completely wrong about this but hoping an interesting discussion arises and some awareness gets spread.",Discussing the new IT Rules / Regulations and the Whatsapp debacle,Law & Courts, Do you not see the problem in the issues you yourself have highlighted?

By 2024, many non vaccinated people would have died due to COVID19 and hence the % of vaccinated people out of remaining population will go up to 80+%.  This is Modi ji's masterstroke. 

\#Modifor2029 and #Modifor2034. Supapower 2024 Why is this government so stupid? Why can't they just help people and save lives?? As if 75% of the population is going to be there. In 2024 nobody will care a pigs arse about vaccinations. They would be busy rallying around for votes just like they did barely a month ago. So this is the strategy now for 2024 elections. Cloudy sky mein benefit. What's the realistic percentage of people who're willing to get vaccinated? 50%?

If we're having just 70% of vaccinations amongst health care professionals, then I would imagine vaccine hesitation would be more with the general population. 

I know quite a lot of educated people who aren't interested in vaccines. Even the staff at home only went for vaccines after my dad paid for them. And then there's that report which came out yesterday that people were jumping in rivers to avoid getting vaccinated. 

The government needs to figure out a way to spread the word about vaccines. Maybe even do some sort of lottery like what they're doing in US.

nlbi6y,,Subodh Jaiswal as New CBI Director: How CJI Used SC Order to Limit Govt’s Discretion Forever,Politics," >In the selection committee meeting, CJI N.V. Ramana referred to the Supreme Court’s 2019 order to make the choice among various contenders easier. But the **committee** ignored the fact that the same order also disfavoured appointing acting chiefs, which the Centre had done.

CJI Rammana did his job where S.A. Bobde failed (when the [GoI appointed Gujarat cadre IPS officer Praveen Sinha as 'interim' CBI chief](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/praveen-sinha-likely-to-be-officiating-director-of-cbi/article33737056.ece)). I guess any other competent chief would not have played well with the impending elections in important states.

CJI Bobde allowed Praveen Sinha to be appointed CBI Chief despite a 2018 SC  order to not allow appointments of Acting Chiefs to important posts.

&#x200B;

>On July 3, 2018, the Supreme Court bench comprising then CJI Dipak Misra and Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud held that .. *none of the states shall ever conceive of the idea of appointing any person on the post of DGP on acting basis for there is no concept of acting DGP as per the decision in Prakash Singh*  
>  
>The former CJI, S.A. Bobde, as a member of the selection panel on February 3, obviously failed to oppose the interim arrangement which enabled Sinha to look after the duties of the CBI director, even as the government took its own time to convene a meeting of the selection committee to finalise the name of Shukla’s successor.

In the bigger picture, if anyone harbors any doubt that this regime is not reformist, then CBI chief appointments should be a convincing case study. The BJP has aided in the decimation of democratic institutions not just through neglect, but pure malign intent.

Despite numerous commissions and SC orders, police reforms are not favorable for the political class. In fact, the Modi government goes the other way, arguing ['why cant you amend rule](https://www.livelaw.in/centre-moves-sc-modification-direction-tenure-dgps-prakash-singh-case-sc-asks-cant-amend-rules/)s' and ignoring SC orders (with support from judges such as SA Bobde)."

nlb963,"Just an honest question. No disrespect or ridicule meant. 

I grew up in a middle income household and am still pretty much there. I've been a frugal person as a result. When I want to splurge, I usually spend it on food. I'll buy cheese cake or something. 

I wanted to know what other people splurge on.",Redditors from lower/middle income families: What do you like to buy when you can splurge on something?,AskIndia," As a kid, the big splurge I received (once during chidhood) was an assembled cricket kit with boost bat, pepsi ball and a stump set (the best part).

As an adult in a family of 8, mothly biriyani at end of month is something we look forward to (80 per plate x 8 = 640). So it's a splurge.

In lower class circumstances individual splurges are rare. Maybe it's because we feel the need to share whatever little we have as a family or siblings, etc.

Now that I'm older, Amma said how she leared to like snacks that were 2nd or 3rd favorites to the kids; eg: Hard sweets like ginger barfi. Dad; well I never got to saw what he splurged on; a replacaement to a torn beyond repair chappal maybe? I'm not sure what he splurged on. On travelling, electronics, books Booze and snacks.. Mostly of food, after having considerable amount of money I started eating out in fast food chains, mostly on domino's pizza. I try to eat as many food as I can and make a favourite of foods items that I like. Plus on clothing. Now that I have my own income, I splurge on some things. We did not have much money and we only spent on necessities. I still carry these habits, using only public transport, buying the cheapest products unless it is laptop or sth long lasting.

I splurge on books (still buying only what I am sure I will read), clothes (still from cheapest stores or on sale), skincare and haircare products (something that is actually good but budget friendly). I do travel but after researching intensively, finding cheap and also safe options. 

I still don't eat out and cook almost all my meals, buy discount meat and vegetables. I use my clothes till they are worn out and don't use makeup. I rarely go to the cinema and do not buy anything that is not absolutely necessary. Misti doi. (Not the normal brown one, but a white curd one shop makes in my city).

My family almost never consumes any street food, probably once a year we do consume, nither do we spend on anything outside absolute necessity, except misti doi, no one complains even if anyone buys 12Kg for no reason(done that), usually we buy like 5kg after every 2 or 3 weeks Yep, food here too. 

I'm dying to start earning well. I've been starved of hedonism for so long that if and when I come into money, I probably won't know what to splurge on. PS game, electronics, Football related stuff (shoes, entry fee , etc).. Pornhub premium My best friend is from a lower middle class family. He buys books and steam games on sale. I did that last year. Got myself a PS4. Been craving a PS since I found out it existed back in 2001."

I've been wanting to head over to India to live there for a year or two, originally planning for 2020. Obviously big bad virus messed everything up.

I wanted to get some opinions as I wanted to travel throughout the country from the north of Punjab to the south of Kerala.

I'm Puerto Rican, and while I have many Indian friends, all day say that hispanics, even more so other Puerto Ricans, are exceptionally rare in India.

I'm fairly dark and get mistaken for Indian every now and then. How is the general attitude towards a Latino such as myself over there?",How do you all feel about Latino foreigners?,AskIndia," er, the vast majority of Indians in the city or village will consider you an Indian unless you speak. my Ecuadorian friend and his family have always passed as Indians when they visit. some may just assume you're an Indian born abroad, so, don't worry about any actual animosity or hostility. 




there's only a relatively small number of Indians who know much about Latinx people, let alone Mestizos or Native Americans. The more common Spanish-speaking visitors are white.



however, it really depends on which part of the country you are going to. people's attitudes, behaviours and thoughts can be very different depending on which state you are visiting. I bet, more than half of the Indians don't even know what latino, Hispanic, Puerto Rican are. For most of them Latin = Spanish. I've never met anyone from Puerto Rico or south America (India as a travel destination is often not priority for them). I personally would love to welcome you to India and visit our vibrant culture. If possible, get someone who's local while visiting the market to avoid getting scammed. I don't think there is any specific issues which Latino community face in India in general.

As with anyone, India is always a mixed bag of experiences and depends on your expectations. I think people can figure out that you are a foreigner from your body language. Maybe, I'm only guessing. Imo, unless you are white or black, you wouldn't attract much attention. Indians themselves have a range of skin colours from north to south. As many others commented here, you'd probably pass as an Indian unless you start talking haha. Just say pencho a lot when you're in north, no one will care."

Through an Order dated 25th March, 2021, the Central Information Commission (CIC) had accepted our submissions in our [**second appeal**](https://internetfreedom.in/persist-transparency-dpd-cic/) against the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) and directed the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) to re-visit the original RTI application and provide us with a revised reply and the comments, if no valid exemptions could be claimed. The information we sought related to the disclosure of comments on a public consultation on the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018. However, the CPIO simply cited the same exemption under S.8 of the RTI Act that she had provided before the CIC, despite clear directions from the CIC to revisit and revise.

### We just wanted to see the comments to the PDPB consultation, but had to go all the way to the CIC for it

When it comes to the Personal Data Protection Bill, the drafting, vendor selection and choices made by the ""expert"" committee have been the subject of a long standing controversy, and [**civil society has criticised it for lacking diversity and expertise**](https://www.epw.in/engage/article/politics-indias-data-protection-ecosystem). One of the ways to overcome this criticism is through transparency. To further this, we filed an RTI application seeking more information not only on its working but the comments which were sent in response to a public consultation, and made the following requests:

1. Kindly provide the number and a list of the names of persons who received comments and feedback.
2. Please provide an inspection of any and all comments and feedback and records along with file notings of the feedback process of the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill.
3. Provide a copy of all comments and feedback received in electronic form on CD or by copies made available on pen drive or email.

This disclosure has strangely been resisted by MeitY, who initially denied to disclose the information without quoting any provision of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (RTI Act) to justify why such denial is legal. This stance was changed before the First Appellate Authority, where the CPIO sought refuge under Section 8(1)(i) of the RTI Act, which states that cabinet papers are exempt from disclosure. We took this case to the CIC, where IFF's Of Counsel Advocate [**Vrinda Bhandari**](https://twitter.com/VrindaBhandari) was accompanied by CCG Litigation Fellow who is hosted at IFF, [**Krishnesh Bapat**](https://twitter.com/krishnesh78).

Before the CIC, the CPIO submitted her Written Submissions, where she changed her stance again, and added another ground under which to seek refuge - S. 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act, which exempts from disclosure information relating to parliamentary privilege. We argued that neither S. 8(1)(i) nor 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act apply to the information we sought; that denial of access to information through any exemption under S. 8 of the RTI Act has to be justified through extensive written reasons and that the CPIO cannot simply reproduce the provision mechanically (See [***Supreme Court of India v. Subhash Chandra Agarwal***](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/27009576/), (2020) 5 SCC 481, para 133); and that in any event, under Section 8(2) of the RTI Act a public authority may allow access to information if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.

The CIC accepted our arguments, and held that the reply of the CPIO was grossly improper, and that the exemptions claimed under S. 8 of the RTI Act were not justified even though the onus to prove that a denial of a request was justified is on the CPIO. The CIC directed the CPIO to re-visit the RTI application and provide a revised reply to the appellant, and if she is not able to justify the exemption so claimed, then the desired information should be provided.

### MEITY offers the same “grossly improper” response again

On 13th April, 2021, the CPIO sent their revised reply to us. Shockingly, the revised reply was substantially similar to CPIO’s written submissions before the CIC that had already been rejected by the CIC. In the table below, we have reproduced the CPIO’s revised reply and Written Submission for comparison:

**Revised reply by CPIO dated 13.04.2021**

**Written submission by CPIO before the CIC**

Total No. of the responses received: 624.

The submission made to the committee by an

Individual/Agency/Company is meant for processing and examination by the Ministry which on later stage translated into input that became the basis of the draft bill that has been approved by the Cabinet before introduction in Parliament. Accordingly, that information is exempted from disclosure under the Section 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act, 2005 i.e. there shall be no obligation to give any citizen the information, the disclosure of which would cause a breach of privilege of Parliament or the State Legislature. Since Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is still under consideration of the Joint Committee of Parliament, the disclosure of information related to the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 would cause a breach of privilege of Parliament and hence the information, as asked by RTI applicant, is exempted under Section 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act, 2005 and accordingly cannot be provided.

Total No. of the responses received: 624

The submission made to the committee by an Individual/Agency/Company is confidential and meant for examination by the Ministry. The submission alluded to, will later translate into input that goes into the draft bill, that has to be approved by the Cabinet before it is introduced in Parliament. Moreover, as per the Section 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act, 2005, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen the information, the disclosure of which would cause a breach of privilege of Parliament or the State Legislature. As Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is under consideration of the Joint Committee of Parliament, the disclosure of information related to the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 would cause a breach of privilege of Parliament and hence the information, as asked by RTI applicant, cannot be provided.

The CPIO has simply altered the grammar in a few spots and returned the same reply to us. No justification has been provided for why S.8(1)(c) applies to the information we are seeking, beyond what has already been rejected by the CIC. Accordingly, since no justifiable exemption has been found, the CPIO ought to have disclosed the information to us. It is also not the CPIO’s case that the information is not available with the CPIO.

### Our complaint to the CIC

We decided to bring this gross evasion of responsibility on part of the CPIO to the notice of the CIC, by filing a complaint under Section 18(1) of the RTI Act. In our complaint, we have set out the above factual background, including the table illustrating the shocking similarity between the CPIO’s revised reply and the written submissions.

We have submitted that the CPIO has *malafidely* denied information to and has wantonly disregarded the decision of the Hon’ble Commission dated 25th March, 2021, and have prayed for the following relief from the CIC:

1. Issue appropriate orders or directions against the CPIO for acting in disregard of the directions of the Hon’ble Central Information Commission dated 25.03.2021;
2. Issue appropriate orders or directions against the CPIO for malafidely denying information to the Complainant; and
3. Such other reliefs as the Hon’ble Commission deems fit.

In the complaint we have submitted that the CPIO was aware that the Hon’ble Commission had dismissed the justification provided in the Written Submission and yet the CPIO chose to reproduce that justification provided in the ‘revised’ reply. This shows *mala fide* on part of the CPIO wherein she has deliberately refused to provide information without any reasonable cause and with a reckless intention to obstruct disclosure of information.

We have run from pillar to post to attain the information sought in the RTI application filed in October of 2018 and we have not yet received a proper justification why the information is being denied, let alone the information itself. However, we do not intend to let this matter go without a lawful conclusion.

We believe that the [**Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB)**](https://internetfreedom.in/tag/dataprotectiontop10/) is going to be a huge step in the field of your privacy. Whether this is a step forward or a step backward can only be determined through transparency and honesty on the part of MeitY. That is why it is crucial to see the extent of public participation in the drafting of PDPB, and why the MeitY must take a much more proactive approach towards disclosure of information. We will keep you updated on the progress of our complaint.

That's how India's history has always been - constant white-washing.

Close to 60% of the dollars sold during  the accounting year were sold in the last two months ($50.5 billion of the total $85.2 billion). More than 77% of the dollars sold during the year were sold in the last three months ($65.9 billion of the total $85.2 billion). 

What does this tell us? It tells us that the RBI sold a lot of dollars after the finance minister had presented the budget. And a good chunk of the surplus given to the government was probably thus generated."
nl9nyn,,Guru and Gramophone: Fantasies of Fidelity and Modern Technologies of the Real,Culture & Heritage ," anstract: In postcolonial South India, Karnatic, or South Indian classical, music has come to be prized as one of the signs of uncolonized Indian distinctiveness. Discourse about classical music in South India is dominated by ideas about the primacy of the voice and the importance of oral tradition. But voice and oral tradition have become more than merely descriptive terms in a discourse about authenticity and fidelity to origins that derives its urgency from the perceived onslaught of technologies of recording and reproduction. The significance of these terms is apparent from the way they are used to oppose Karnatic music to a generalized idea of Western music: whereas Western music is instrumental, Karnatic is vocal; whereas Western music is ""technologically"" superior, Karnatic is more ""spiritual""; whereas Western music can be played just by looking at written music (or so the stereotype goes), Karnatic is passed on through a centuries-long oral tradition and a system of teaching that technology cannot duplicate. This article concerns the quest for authenticity in twentieth-century discourse on Karnatic music and its relationship to technologically conceived ideas of fidelity and authority. I focus on moments when practices and ideas of listening, performing, and music itself seem to change in conjunction with technologies of recording and broadcasting. In particular, I note the emergence of certain fantasies and anxieties about the replacement of the human guru with a machine, the quantification of music, the collapse of time, the reproducibility of the voice, and the possibility of complete loss. Rather than narrate the takeover of a ""traditional"" practice by ""modern"" technologies, I show how ideas about authenticity, tradition, and modernity were—and continue to be—shaped in the very encounter with such technologies. My focus here is on the discursive networks in which technologies take their place as points of relay between bodies, sounds, writing, and forms of power. A number of issues emerge here concerning the relationship between fidelity and authority. On the one hand, technologies of recording and broadcasting create a disruption of traditional modes of teaching, performing, and listening—a disturbance that is experienced by musicians and listeners variously as a forgetting of voice, a loss of face-to-face contact, and a speeding up of time. If the guru's authority is in part produced by the fidelity of his sisya, or disciple, fidelity carried to an extreme threatens that authority. On the other hand, the focus of traditional desire is projected out of the new technologies themselves. The social sense of fidelity, in the distinctly postcolonial sense of fidelity to tradition, loyalty to one's roots and nationality, comes to be modeled on the technological sense of fidelity. Here technologies appear as both destroyers and saviors, as instruments of both memory and forgetting, and longing for the past is accompanied by an odd sense of futurity. The short story ""Vidwan"" [The musician] (Malan 1981) begins with a classic scene of artistic angst, as its protagonist, the violinist Janakiraman, struggles to express a musical idea. He is interrupted by the arrival of a former student from America, Joseph Om. Om had miraculously sought out Janakiraman, a simple, unassuming man who cared only about music, who had spent his life teaching students. But there had been no student he could call a real sisya until Om had..."

nl9gob,,Ancient origins of low lean mass among South Asians and implications for modern type 2 diabetes susceptibility,Science/Technology," > Contemporary South Asians typically have lower lean mass (organ and muscle mass) relative to stature and total body mass than Europeans8, which may partly explain why they develop NCDs at a lower BMI than other populations. South Asian low lean mass is present at birth, and this difference becomes more pronounced after adjusting for their low average birth weight9. Neonatal low lean mass persists even four or five generations after migration to other parts of the world including the UK10,11, Netherlands12 and Surinam13, despite changes in diet and environment. This suggests the phenotype is heritable in the broader sense, but whether by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms is unknown. Lower lean mass is associated with lower glucose clearance and possibly earlier beta-cell exhaustion14, so is thought to contribute causally to elevated diabetes risk15 in the context of obesity. Contemporary South Asians are also generally characterised by relatively short stature16, which is associated with lower glucose tolerance independently of body mass17 and may act as a marker of T2D susceptibility, including during pregnancy2,18.

Kudos. It wasn't just bhakts.

A lot of companies donate as a part of CSR. Since Chief Minister's relief funds did not count as CSR but PMCares did, most companies donated there. I believe that the CSR donations would form a much larger chunk of PMCares than individual donations.

Even if it was just bhakts, the money was collected in the name of the Prime Minister, and every citizen should have the right to know what  happens to it.

nl918z,"*I was privileged enough that in the past week I've managed to get the members of my family vaccinated with both the doses after having taken my own in January.*

**This post is to serve as a handy guide to anyone intending to get themself or a relative vaccinated.**

First, some statistics:

Bengaluru's Total Population: 1.25 Crore.
 
It's 18-44 Age Population: 75 Lakh

This means 60% of the population is only now starting to be vaccinated.

**Let's dive into some details -**

**Which One Should I Take?**

Any, there isn't enough research backing the absolute superiority of one over the other yet. Moreover, all vaccines go a long way in helping mitigate the severity of the disease should you unfortunately contract it.
However, if you are looking to travel abroad then you'll have to check with the WHO and the said country's guidelines on what vaccines they've approved.
* Covishield is in adequate supply.
* Covaxin has faced short-supply before but is being upscaled.
* Sputnik V is relatively new and production maybe slow but is however backed by Big Pharma so a shortage could be unlikely.

My suggestion would be for you take the one that is most accessible and not worry too much about the intricate details of vaccine research and go out of your way to procure any specific dose.



**Why Should I Take It?**

It important to take the vaccine because that is the only way for India to prevent the imminent Third-Wave. A lot of vaccine-deniers of the 45+ group and also some from the medical fraternity were seen rushing to get their doses during the peak of the Second Wave whilst they were completely hesitant in February and March.
Such a situation is inevitable during the peak of the Third Wave wherein lakhs of erstwhile-deniers will flock for their vaccines. 
My hope is for you to not be one of them. Like they say in Stock Market speak: Buy the Dip. You should get vaccinated when the cases dip.



**When Can I Get It?**

If you are 18+, you can get it now at a handful of private hospitals and some select government establishments.
If you are 45+, you can get it anywhere.
Stay updated with the news on government's orders on whether to vaccinate the young crowd and when to do it, as this maybe subject to change based the availability of the vaccine itself.



**Where Can I Get It?**

[Here](https://www.cowin.gov.in/home) you'll need to search by District and choose Karnataka and either BBMP or Bangalore Urban while you constantly check for what places are vaccinating and to what age groups.
This list is ever-expanding and there's a new centre being added all the time so be watchful and don't give up after trying just a couple of times.
This is also the only reliable list as of now and Arogya Setu isn't as efficient as doing it here.



**How Can I Get It?**

Firstly, you'll need to register your Name, Aadhar and Phone Number with CoWIN.
Please do this right now or at the least before you step out vaccine-hunting.
Each number can be used to register 4 different people so don't worry about that.
Secondly, if you can afford a paid vaccine and/or are sufficiently tech-savvy please try to book an appointment before you step out. I would suggest you to prefer a private hospital or clinic which carries a price tag if you can afford to pay since doing it will ensure that the free vaccines go to those in the real need for them and that you receive the benefit of a better crowd management and faster service.
Thirdly, do not give up after just a few attempts of trying to book an appointment. There's a race of the fingers out there and giving up will only ensure your loss.
Follow these telegram groups to get instant updates on when booking opens for various centres -
[here.](https://covialerts.in/)


Most private clinics open for booking at the same time everyday (ex- 5pm for Manipal Clinic) so be logged in and prepared minutes beforehand. You can find details on when they open up by calling the said hospital or checking through the telegram group on their previous history. Note that these hospitals may not vaccinate without a booking, so call them beforehand if you're planning to walk-in.

Lastly, General Hospitals/UPHCs may require prior booking or follow a token system for which you'll have to wait in long congested queues and may have to arrive at the location prior to 7 am on occasion. A large section of the population goes here owing to the digital divide and you should expect a few skirmishes and angry crowds at some places due to the disadvantages they've been dealt.

During this process, it is important for all of us to be empathetic and mindful of the everyday struggles of health workers, security personnel, fellow citizens and the police.

Don't forget to carry your appointment confirmation slip and Aadhar when stepping out and if you're doing it the offline-way then please do not go further than your nearest UPHC/General Hospital.

Those who are waiting for a second dose and may have surpassed the recommended due date, please do not panic or give up hope. Check with the place where you took the first dose. Most centres are ensuring priority service to such individuals.

Please motivate your neighbours, house-help, family and friends to get vaccinated because that is currently the best thing an average Indian could do as National Service.",Vaccine Handbook of Bengaluru,Coronavirus," * [Covid-19 Megathread for Discussions is live here>>](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/n1plmu/coronavirus_covid19_discussion_megathread_9/)

Could someone with knowledge of this tell me more about which place is easier to find work/settle down in and the process for doing it. Due to being assigned to COVID care, I couldn't get much practice to do surgeries during the first year of my MS and it appears that the situation will prevail for some time. I am open to doing MS again abroad given that I will get an adequate stipend to manage my own expenses. Please comment/DM. Thanks.",Help and suggestions regarding immigration after MS in ENT from India,Non-Political," Not sure if you can use India MS in ENT in Australia without going through the curriculum and passing an equivalent exam considered in Australia.

nkvk71,"OK, I have had enough of this nonsense and it is time someone says this out loud.

I have been seeing so many posts on FB and whatsapp messages that say India's war with Covid is so bad because (i) the pharma companies are conspiring by selling useless drugs  (ii) forcing India to buy vaccines (by Pfizer) and (iii) Biden has conspired to stop raw material exports in order to force India to buy its vaccines.

Let me tackle each one of them separately.

1. Pharma companies are conspiring to sell drugs. For one, our knowledge of the decease is evolving. Unfortunately, the decease is also evolving leaving some of our knowledge out of date. What this means is, nobody really knows what's working and what's not and everyone is trying to figure it out as we go along. When we see something is working, we are trying it in bigger numbers. The Pharma companies are struggling to manufacture the drug that meets all regulatory requirements in numbers they aren't prepared to manufacture. Yet, everyone is trying their best to do the best they can. None of the Pharma companies raised the prices of their products so far. In fact, pretty much all foreign companies have supplied their products to India at reduced prices or allowed Indian companies to produce at next to nothing royalties. Agreed that we are dependent on Pharma companies but aren't we all paying taxes that the government has a responsibility to subsidize the prices instead of asking / expecting the pharma companies to subsidize on our behalf? Say  I have a marriage in my house and need to feed 1000 people, and you have a catering company, are you going to supply food for free? The best you will do is, give me 10 or 20% discount. Not supply for free. So what's this obsession with blaming pharma companies?
2. Forcing India to buy Pfizer vaccines: India has an indigenous vaccine (Covaxin) made by Bharat Biotech. Covaxin is known to work against all variants of Coronavirus, including the Indian variants. So, why don't India increase capacity domestically instead of accusing Pfizer or Moderna about shenanigans. It's not like pfizer doesn't have enough demand outside of India. They do. When there are dead bodies on the street, why are we getting political about how much to pay? We pay more for iPhones & Samsung phones and cars than Americans pay but we want the vaccines to be cheaper? What is happening to our priorities? Didn't we learn the lesson that when it comes to vaccines, speed matters more than price? A 3000 Rs vaccine investment will save a person's life and yet we are squabbling over whether it should be 3000Rs or 2000Rs. I have a cousin and a friend  who are under 40 who died recently because they didn't get vaccine. They both spent over 20 lakhs in hospitals for ventillator support. Wouldn't they be better off spending for vaccines a fraction of that amount and BE ALIVE?
3. Biden conspiracy against raw materials: Why the hell is India raising concerns about raw material in 2021 April when we should have had contracts for raw material supply inked and signed in 2020 itself? Who leaves the supply of critical raw materials in the air when we knew for sure that we needed to make enough vaccines to vaccinate all adults in the country a long time. Unless, Indian government never wanted to vaccinate a substantial portion anyway - which is quite evident from the get go. So, all those countries that paid advance towards vaccines - were they stupid? They paid those advances so that the manufacturers could buy or pay for raw material shipments into the future with certainity. America works with American interests at heart. That's why they paid advances to four pharma companies for 4 times their population to be vaccinated which is why they have surplus in reserves. India spent ZERO dollars / rupees in India towards vaccine production. It left both Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech to their devices to manufacture the vaccine. Heck, India put a price control on both of them to supply at 150Rs per dose when Pfizer is selling the same to the US at 20$ - approx 1500 Rs - 10 times what India is paying - that too advance payment. Can you see the stupidity of Indian government? We chopped the Indian companies balls by putting price controls on them, limiting how much they can scale manufacturing and limiting exports and thereby limiting how much these companies can make.

Anyway, Indian government has fucked up big time vaccinating its citizens so stop blaming foreign companies, foreign governments and foreigners for the shit India is in today. It is 100% self made. There is nobody to blame but India and Indians.  
P.S: If any of you know Gaurav Pradhan, the idiot BJP supporter disguising as a data scientist, tag him to comment on this because his message is what triggered me. Looks like his twitter handle is banned.",Stop blaming foreigners and foreign companies for what's going on in India,Foreign Relations," I think it's the time to accept the fact : india got no ethics and tops in hypocrisy. 

Is there a way to give hope for ethical people in India? Its so easy to deflect and blame someone for our problems. After all it takes a lot of time and effort to find a solution. This is the Indian way of the public sector and the Govt. And if you think about it, look at the monkeys making policy. Most of them don't have the necessary policy making experience and have only made decisions to suit their own interest. What do you think was going to happen for a global calamity like Covid.

We seem to be so engrossed in proving our side to be right that we end up supporting something that we would not have if it was not for the bias we have developed.

For ex:

- Because I hate the present PM, I will glorify the big tech and support all their actions

- Because I love the present PM, I will support a ban on big tech and free speech


Don't we see how it is hurting our own well being in the end? 

If there's a ban, we will lose all the positive things that platforms like twitter and facebook have given us.

If there are no local laws on what the big tech is doing, they will do anything unchecked and shape opinions. 

Both of them are trying to make us choose one side or the other where they're the ones who will benefit. We lose our platform for free speech, or we get suspended/ labelled as manipulative (based on whatever is being supported by them). 

What we could be focusing on is WHAT LAWS? so that they aren't there just to serve the government sell there propaganda. Or Idk something better that you could come up with if you weren't so caught up with supporting/opposing.

No human being can make all right or all wrong decisions. But it's our(and the media's) right and duty to hold them accountable for their decisions. 
And just because we oppose something doesn't mean we have to support what's opposing them for another reason. 

Is it ok to ""befriend the enemy's enemy"" and support one wrong to oppose another?",Why can't we just be neutral and objectively assess things?,Politics," Don't we see how it is hurting our own well being in the end?  
\[ndfwguy\] yes we do. However, as long as fb and others repeat it's users privacy, it is all good. 

And why are we relating the Indian majority religion vs minority religion with American race conflicts by calling one privileged? 

\[ndfwguy\] agreed.However, if only people treat each other as human beings... respect each other, it would be nice. Can I give you an example? people go to Lord Narayana temples and given a chance, they want to touch his feet, with their forehead. and then probably say ""Ohm Namo Narayanaya namah"" and then walk away. They walk out of the temple and see some downtrodden (lower caste, upper caste beggars, etc)  and treat them as trash. Yet, the Lord says that the Shudras emanated from his feet... riddle me that. These could be from another religion or just lower caste. we don't know. I am sure I will get downvoted to hell but so be it... 

Until human beings learn to respect other human beings, irrespective of caste, creed, religion, status in society, how much money they have, etc... it probably won't matter. The fault has become with the so called debate culture in the mainstream media. Firstly, shouting out and calling names to each other isn't debating. You can hold on to multiple opinions but that no longer exists, you are labelled either with the government or anti-India. That needs to stop, it's quite simply fragmenting people. Next, laws are important, but if those laws are unconstitutional for a cosmopolitan society to function with its free speech, then those are obviously wrong. Third, the thing about being neutral always doesn't make sense, your silence or so called objective neutrality is very easily exploited by the oppressor (here the state) as something in favour of their judgement. That is why opposing something is the right way to go if you even an iota of doubt about something. Understanding what it means, studying it, unlearning your own biases and then forming an opinion should be the norm."

She/he will be the best person to give you right advise. 

As long as your medication doesn't have any effect on your blood thickness in general (if it was to make any thicker, doc would have prescribed a maintenance dose of ecosprin etc) you are safe to take the vaccine. 

Please talk to your doctor who is treating you. Not a doctor, but the answer is - no one knows for sure. Here's an excerpt from a Canadian advisor https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/sciencebrief/vaccine-induced-immune-thrombotic-thrombocytopenia-vitt-following-adenovirus-vector-covid-19-vaccination-lay-summary/ :


> Are certain people more likely to get VITT?

> At this time, we do not know if certain patients are more likely to get VITT. Currently, we do not have any evidence that VITT is more common in people who have had blood clots before, people with a family history of blood clots, people on birth control or other hormones, people with autoimmune disease, people with low platelets or other platelet disorders, or pregnant people, because VITT does not develop through the same process as more common types of bleeding or clotting problems. It may be possible, however, that people with a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT) with low platelets are at increased risk of VITT; they should receive an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) rather than an adenoviral vector vaccine."

But now due to certain complications, it is developing into a **hemorrhagic tumor** again. To reduce the chance of the cancer relapsing, doctors have recommended **tumor removal using laparoscopy and then removal of ovaries.** The entire treatment would cost about Rs. 10 to 12L.

Only time this can be a wake-up call is if it actually seriously affects the ruling class like the politics parties , even after the pandemic the best we can hope for is for these fucks to loose the election that's all, no jail time no lawsuits nothing , no reprecussions for being totally underprepared, no reprecussions for pedelling pseudoscience like  Aayush and whatever cow shit ramdev is pissing in.

nl7mha,"Hello,

I am a second generation Indian American. I was born in the US, but my parents are from London and their families are from India. I am 21 now and I would like to learn an Indian language before it is too late. Here are the languages I am considering:

1.	**Hindi**. Obviously Hindi is a top contender because it is so wildly spoken and ubiquitous. This would probably be the most practical and useful pick.
2.	**Marathi**. My dad’s family is from Maharashtra and my dad and his mother both speak Marathi. I think it sounds beautiful.
3.	**Gujarati**. My mom’s family speaks Gujarati (with some elements of Swahili) and I am able to understand most utterances, so this would likely be the easiest for me to learn.
4.	**Kannada**. My dad’s family also speaks Kannada (but not as frequently or fluently as Marathi). I understand that this is a Dravidian language and very different from the previous 3, but learning it might be more beneficial from an intellectual standpoint and maybe more interesting.

So given these points, which language do you think would both serve me well and be fun to learn?",What language should I learn as an American?,AskIndia," Hindi & Marathi. If u learn one learning the other shouldnt be that hard In terms of usefulness around India  it'd be Hindi coming from a Malayali 

In terms of usefulness in and outside India (especially) would be Malayalam due to the large amounts of Malayalis overseas.

But OP, learn whatever language you want, theres no compulsion to learn the top 2, anything that interests you be it Asamese or Telegu and on. Marathi and Hindi Hindi will be easier learn for you considering your parents probably still speak Hindi or even your family friends. Marathi is fairly easier to learn once you have decent Hindi skills mainly because many words are similar between Hindi and marathi. 

Best of kuchh and do let me know if you ever need any help with either of those languages. Hindi, most spoken language(60%) in India. Hindi. Undoubtedly

Reason 1 - much easier than most other Indian languages, can be picked up pretty soon, and doesn't have difficult pronunciation like Dravidian languages. I'm not saying it's superior, but definitely Malayalam is more difficult to pick up as an adult, and Tamil is like climbing Everest. I'm a North Indian living down south in India and according to ease of speaking I find its Telugu/Kannada then Malayalam then Tamil. And this is the experience of some of my friends too. 

Reason 2 - most of the Indian diaspora outside speak functional Hindi, no matter where they're from. I've worked with Malayalees, Telugus, Tamilians overseas and they all spoke decent Hindi. 

Reason 3 - Even if u visit South India, in most of the major towns & cities ppl will understand Hindi.

Reason 4 - India is known outside a lot by its Bollywood. U can't claim to be an Indian (outside India at least) and not have access to iconic Bollywood dialogues. And that's all Hindi.

Reason 5 - If u can achieve a degree of fluency in Hindi, u can understand a bit of Punjabi, Haryanvi, Marathi, Bhojpur, Gujarati, Bengali, Odiya etc. Not too much, but at least it won't be all sounding like ancient Latin. 

Reason 6 - The most important reason. If u want to stay updated with the Mann Ki Bakwaas of our supreme leader and listen to his mind-numbing speeches, Hindi is a must."

The rise we see is not a definite one, we saw crashes in last week and week before that.

 Pharma seems to thriving, look at Dr. Reddys. Tells you how it operates, which is in future prediction. All this money is on bet that company will rake in good revenue. So it's not a sign of current situation of economy. 

Mostly investment isn't based on stats of economy but narrative based. For example I might look at news that big giant is in discussion with a small player,.I will choose to invest in small player.  If so turns out that big giant in talks may or may not go as expected.  Showing my investment are going to be in loss or profit. 

Also, most people who invest in stock are affluent and are ones who can afford to lose that much. 


Whereas, country's economy depends mainly on  goods, services and exchange of money. Yes, stock market and economy not an independent entities. They do have relations to a narrow extent  

Hence the increase in unemployment while stock rose for a day. And it's relations are narrower given the wealth distribution of this country. One section if people have too much money to invest while the other might be losing his job. Also we have major intra day traders given lockdown and halt in flow of cash in market making it more uncertain, My portfolio has gone up by almost 34% since mar 2020. At least something positive during lock down. >Is stock market really an indicator of economy as some claim it to be?

Not often. Sometimes (pre-covid like January 2020) they converge and that gives off the impression that the stock market is always based on the present state of the economy. Stock market is not a very good indicator of the economy. It depends on how optimistic the traders feel about the future of the company/economy. 

I haven't been following the Indian stock market these past few weeks but I'm gonna guess that it has to do with the long-term outlook (1 year from now maybe?), the lack of a complete national lockdown, or even the hope that many people will be vaccinated soon and everything will return to normal. Last year there was a big crash because we knew nothing about this virus and it was sudden. Now, everyone's familiar with it and know that it can be controlled in a few months. Please correct me if I'm wrong about this Stock market is more sentimental than anything.

Reasons for raising:

With the covid getting over by next year or so, then india will be a manufacturing hub and it's a good investment.

With vaccination done on major countries, the poor countries need cheap vaccination. Indian pharma manufacturers are some of the biggest in the world, so invest in them.

Indians are going to be a long time stuck on the EMI loans, good to invest there.

Car and other manufacturing is seen as a good investment because of post covid world.

More Robin Hood (not the broker, novice traders) players are in indian markets since the last lock down, too.

Indian Markets are far better regulated than a few large markets so a safer bet.

With people losing trust on USA (and dollar) for the last few years might be factor too here. Inflation Because BJ Pee gobarment sucking taxpayers and filling nadani, champani and chaddichandan gang's coffers. Like build airport by spending 50000 crores and lease it to nadani for 1000 crores for 99 years."

What is NYT's problem here? The govt. is trying its best to limit the damage done but they keep throwing numbers without looking at the bigger picture. 

Covid 19 is a seasonal pandemic that'll leave, eventually. But overpopulation is here to stay, measures need to be taken to limit that. One such method and proposed theory by Dr. Kumar Gandu Patra of WhatsApp University has been to gradually offset the weaker and lesser populations. Such as but not limited to muslims, dalits and anti-nationals. The first beta test was unsuccessful but the second one has been successfully, while the theoretical capacity of this pandemic to kill is phenomenal, it knows no boundaries and picks almost anyone. So, the good old tried and true method of targetted riots from 2002 will be applied to curb the overpopulation. As Vallabhbhai Patel once said, ""leniency on leeches leads to infections on your beloved cows!"" Globally, the mortality rate is around 2%. But the Indian figures don't follow that ratio.

nl5uo5,Subtle issues in the society: Talking about women in a demeaning way in movies. Grandparents wanting a 'grandson' for the family and sad if a girl child is born. Saying motherhood is the only role of women. No maternity benefits in companies. Not hiring women because they might quit anytime. No return to work policies. No work from home opportunities like in the West. Not allowing girl children to study. Saying girls are very textbookish without giving them opportunities. Not allowing women to do funeral rites. Saying ' women know women are evil' thats a stereotype. Eve teasing. Judging a girl for behavior instead of a boy if bad incidents happen. Not renting out homes to single women. Looking down upon women who don't have children. Asking women when are you going to have a baby? Not educating the girl child. The list is endless. How is it ever going to change?,Improve attitudes towards women,AskIndia," Treating a woman/girl as a person first and not the gender.   Makes a huge difference to be treated equally.

Also, if everyone just wants sons, good luck to them in finding a wife in the future with such skewed male to female population ratios. Most Indian men have Madonna complex irrespective of their background. Woman is either a pious devi or a whore. STOP putting them on a pedestal ! Treat women like human beings, as is their inalienable right. This in-turn gives rise to groups that want to ensure the purity of the ""pious"" image. That's why interfaith marriages are so controversial. Understanding that a female is a female even if she is not a wife or a mother will go a long way towards changing the society. Also, this notion of purity is why widow/ divorcee remarriage is frowned upon. But I watch Indian movies.

Being a creep is cool and that's how you get all the ladies.
I don't think you have seen enough movies.

Honestly things are a mess. And it won't solve easily. The best we can do is try and be a bit more decent people than others. Hope we improve things slowly [deleted] That stuff is milquetoast compared to the rape problem. We need gender studies since pre school to correct that shit. I'd vote for anyone who proposes this. Solution: when your grandparents gets judgemental about a women, offer them a ticket to an old age home, that will quickly quiet them up. Wait until you hear about defending a pedeophile because the person who got harassed was a girl. Let that bigotry die with them. I might sound harsh but thats the only way.
At that age biases are too deep rooted for intervention The most important thing to consider for today's generation is to view the other gender as 'ally'. When men starts to acknowledge the effects of patriarchy not only in women's life, but their lives as well; we will be able to break this system which benefitted from pitting a man against a woman.
I am appalled by so many men/women being misogynist/misandrist, just because one feels the other has it better in life. We need to let it sink into our psyche that no one has it better and the only path to betterment is to reject patriarchy. Yes the attitudes currently are bad. But we have progressed so much! From sati to dowry to female independence to pro choice abortion. It is very tough to change the general attitudes towards women. But I believe we get there soon. Take a look at 1950s and now. A lot has been changed in the favour for women and yes we have lots of way to go. 

Right now there are several programs and investments that helps women. 

Maha shakti kendras -> https://wcd.nic.in/schemes/mahila-shakti-kendras-msk 
Sukanya Samridhi Yojana which is tax free investment of 8% return for the daughter's education. 
Mahila-E-Haat -> is a program that helps female entrepreneurs. 

It will take time, thank god we have lots of role models that are/were in a position of authority like sonia gandhi, indira gandhi. And there are several successful female entrepreneurs in India. For example Upasana Taku founded mobikwik. 


Education and less of religious schooling is way to go. And more campaigning of successful female entrepreneurs in the media. This will change the attitude. 

IMO, more drastic measures needed right now is women safety. We need to invest more on security to make women feel safe and we need to do this very soon."

nl5p72,People are overworking during the pandemic. and otherwise Western countries have better work culture and do 9 to 5 jobs. How do we nudge companies to improve working conditions for men and women?,How do you get companies to improve working conditions?,AskIndia," I'd like to make one correction here we've been doing this thing even before pandemic. 

It's really sad but overwork is glorified in Indian companies not sure about other sectors but IT companies are the worst when it comes to 9-5. Somehow we feel guilty for leaving early just because we've completed our work or taking a paid leave for that matter. 🤦🏼‍♂️

Edit: To answer your question sadly it won't speaking from personal experience, I talked to the HR, my supervisor, my hiring manager because the work condition was terrible and none of them did anything to improve it. 

Plus the labour laws are even bad I read somewhere that government is planning a 4 day work policy but you've to work for 12 hours daily . Not sure what happened to this law but not sure how it'll help the employees. General strikes. Unions.  Class conciousness. Well, if a company can exploit its worker, it will. Don't believe me? Just search, ""Amazon working conditions"". Why? Mostly because they can. There are people without jobs and have their families dependent on them. Therefore, they are ready to do anything to get a job, you ask them to work for 18 hours a day, they will. There are laws that are supposed to save us from such things, but how many people really fight against it? And then again, if you fight against them, they will simply replace you, unless you are a valuable asset to them, but would they exploit you in the first place then?

The only way I can think of things to improve is if we start appreciating every job and people, maybe then we can see their struggle. Why I say that? It is obvious that companies (almost all the time) exploit people lowest in the hierarchy and if people above them start to care and appreciate them, things could actually change, otherwise? I don't really think so. This is just my opinion. Let's start a company review &r ating site? Rate on company culture, salaries, peer quality, politics, innovation, etc.  If this becomes popular companies will be forced to improve their culture else face the consequences of nobody joining them(practically hard in India as number of jobs < number of people) but people with more options might keep it as a parameter.

nl0kvl,"Hi
I would like to appeal to redditors to create well written and researched WhatsApp forwards. These can be used to counter the propaganda that comes everyday on our groups.
You don't need to reply to all of accusations or false claims. Only a few , even one would suffice.",Destroying WhatsApp forwards,AskIndia," This initiative must be done... I am sure we have a lot of researchers here who could cite right sources. I have found that just a simple request like a gentle reminder:
""Dear (insert)
I received your message. I was hoping to engage / would like further information/ your opinion  
On the text/image/ news item 
That you have sent .""
This always enough for the people sending the message to back off. 
Remember that for evil to succeed in the world it is enough for good men to not speak I recieved one long WhatsApp forward, the gist was : india good everyone bad.
I would like to begin by gently destroying one part. I hope if you receive any such forwards you can use the material to return to sender. 
Generally people attach  words like
"" forwarded as received ""
I think we should respond by:
"" Please don't forward messages if you do not agree with content of the message.
If you are in agreement with the gist or intent or content of the message, I am happy to receive these messages.
In such circumstances please write :
"" I  agree with the content , gist or intent of the message.""
"" I endorse the message. ""
""I stand by the message.""
This will allow the people receiving the message to engage in questions or debate. 
Otherwise when you question the authenticity of the message, you are told that the message sender has no way of verifying the truth of the message. Try making a sub like theunkillnetwork and organise a few things to forward You should counter this propaganda messages by breaking down their claims with facts. For each claim in the message, share a news or video link with a fact that counters it. Website like: Alt news are good sources of verifying the truth of the message. 
However let us realise that the person sending the message is not interested in the authenticity of the message. He or she is forwarding the message as a part of an emotional response. 
This emotional response is to create more ""stickiness"" in a relationship. 
For example, an old family member sends a hateful message. You are shocked , you react . This is exactly the one of the two responses the message was designed to elicit. 
The first reponse: agreement and vindication of a prejudicial belief about big government, big pharma, big banks , other people.
The second response: wtf
Both of these responses score a victory for the message.
There is a third way . It requires a subtle change in thinking and it is only this:
"" I completely agree/ vehemently disagree with the message ""
BUT
""I must decrease my emotional response to the message ""
AND
""I should interact with person sending the message "" My wife( wiser than me) tells me that most Indian men are emotionally immature. 
Her hypothesis is that as children in Indian families ,there is are 2 things which are lacking:
No reflection back on emotions being felt as a child.
We are not taught to identify or name the emotion we are feeling as children.
Since identifying emotional response is half the battle. 
Let me give an example, a toddler throws a toy down and crosses her arms.
The Indian mother would mostly say"" Aww, you are looking cute ""or many variations on the theme.
What I suggest we should respond is by identifying the emotion the child is feeling. Like, "" You are angry"" Not as question or argument or as a threat but a neutral statement of fact delivered in a deadpan face. This helps the child understand her emotion by giving it a name.
The second thing which we lack: how to argue or disagree without giving offence.
This creates a toxic culture of hypocrisy. I would like the readers of this post to remind themselves of this simple dictum:
"" Behaviour is not intent in circumstances where behaviour is at odds with previous actions ""
Your family member loves you and treats other people with respect most of the time. This is their character, this who they are. If they forward a hateful message remember their actions come from love.
They are either angry or afraid or anxious, the message is just a means to let you know that. It is the unconscious way of sending an SOS.
You can react anyway you want"

I'm planning on getting the phone on EMI, have to look into that. Planning on getting Bajaj Finserv one cause from what I saw, that seems to be the easiest one accessible to me since I had an FD there once.

&#x200B;

Important Things (The testing websites require me to screen record my app usage with audio commentary so please keep that in mind):

1. The phone should have **Android Version > 7.0** (So the latest or close to the latest versions of Android Software).
2. **Excellent Microphone Quality.**
3. **Large Storage.**
4. ***A good camera*** (Front and Back) doesn't need to be the best, but it should at least look good and presentable to clients.
5. Should be able to ***run the newest games*** (***Don't need the best high performance***, I just need it to run at a normal level and be playable).
6. **Long Battery Life** (This is kind of important because my current Lenovo Phone's battery  3300 mAh was horrendous for my work).
7. Sturdy phone.

***Please Note: I want the phone to be Google Play Protect certified. I regularly use Banking apps and I remember my mother's phone not allowing that because it was not Google Protect Certified.***

However, this is the first time I'll be a pet owner and I'm very excited about it. Can some of you impart your wisdom upon me so that this won't be a complete cat-astrophe? Any tips are appreciated!",AskIndia," 1. Cats love cleanliness. You won't have problems with them pooping around. A cat will automatically look for a proper, secluded place to poop. So all you have to do is put a litter box out and let your cat know it's there. Human toilet training is going to be challenging though.  
Make sure you keep the litter box and surrounding areas clean at all times.

2. Be careful while walking/stepping on things - even while you're about to lie down on your bed. The kitty might run around your foot and get hurt. It might hide under the bedsheet and get hurt if you lie down without checking

3. Every cat is different - you will see youtube videos about certain cats being very affectionate and clingy - that might not be the case with your cat. Cats generally dislike cuddling, however, they will get more affectionate as they grow older.

4. If you're living in a high rise apartment, make sure to completely cat proof your balconies and windows. Cats are liquid, and they can pass though very small gaps. If you have a pigeon net in your balcony, make sure that there are no gaps around the edges, and the net is extremely tight.  
Although cats are pretty agile and have low terminal velocity, I've heard of cases where the cat falls off a balcony and dies.

5. Make sure that the first thing you do is to take it to the vet. It is essential that you kitty gets vaccinated and dewormed ASAP, since the mortality rate in young untreated kittens is very high. Also get the kitty neutered/spayed when your vet recommends it. Do NOT take it to a private clinic, unless you know the vet personally. Take the kitty to a proper vet hospital.  
If the vet prescribes any suppliments/vitamins - just ignore those. They're expensive and useless.

6. A kitty might eat grass from time to time and vomit. This is perfectly normal. They intentionally do this to clean their stomach.

7. If the kitty is seeking corners to hide and sleep in, and not playing around and not eating, take it to a vet ASAP.

8. Getting zoomies after taking a poop is normal and adorable.

9. Every expensive toy you buy for the cat will remain unused. Every piece of junk the cat finds will become its favorite toy.

10. Kitties grow really quickly - so cherish their childhood :) Hope you have the finances to take care of the cat. You don't know what can happen. Even I thought it would be cheap but I got unlucky twice. It nearly did destroy my savings...

My first cat got dysentery, allergic to grains, and had constant IBS. I think I spent whatever money I managed to save trying to get his condition under control ... poor thing he coudnt control his shit and would poop wherever and it was liquid and tarry and would smell like death. Almost every commercial cat food caused him to get diarrhea - whiskas, me-o, RC, the only food which he could ingest without much problem were the more expensive brands that used meat like schesir. And for the longest time vets coudnt find a cure for him, I remeber those days.. everytime he had an episode they would tell me to give him the medicines and eat the hills prescription diet (i would spend around 600 rs a day on his food) but that food while it gave him releif has a side effect of excessive urination which caused him to be dehydrated... He eventually passed away naturally.


Then my second cat contracted toxoplasma from a foster home I left him in while I was on vacation. For 2 weeks I was running around doing multiple tests to determine what happened to him, it turns out his immune system was compromised so he got FIP (for which there's no cure) I spent over 5 lakhs importing the experimental medicines from Hong Kong to treat FIP and got a local vet to train me in adminstering the doses. But since there's no cure and the unlicensed medicine has a low success rate he did pass. I still remember that day... the virus progressed so much that he had neurological damage, he was paralysed and blind and the only humane thing to do was end his sufferings. 


But this was 4 years ago. For my sanity I haven't adopted anymore pets. And vetenary medicine has gotten better. There are more people out there looking for cures to lethal viruses like FIP and FIV the drug is now finally out of the experimental stages but is not commercially available due to licensing issues. You'd still need to pay 1.5-3 lakhs for it last I heard. Don't give it carbs and home food. I see too many people feeding cats crap. Get proper cat food (dry and wet), or just cook plain meat and fish and give it to them (no salt or anything). 1. Please operate it for birth control.
2. Cats and dogs are known for attacking and killing the local wildlife like small reptile, birds thus disrupting the local ecosystem.
So as owner it is your responsibility to keep a watch...!!! For the first few months, kittens will scratch a lot! That's how they show affection to their mom and siblings."

nkyvtl,"Hi folks, I am asking this on behalf of a friend (27F) who works in database management since the past 3 years but hasn't seen any monetary or designation growth. Recently, during appraisals, she was the only one in her team who did not get it. I suggested her to look elsewhere but she claims she won't get a ***good job*** elsewhere as this one gives her ample freedom. She plans to move when she learns a lot in the current company and plans to move only after 2024. I feel she is living in denial and afraid of change amongst many other things as she claims she does not need much internet for her work so she works from a village using a mobile hotspot which makes me wonder if she is even serious about her job. 

My advice to her usually falls on deaf ears as she claims I don't know her job as I am not from IT but the way I see it, she does not have the best reputation at work and she might be walking on thin ice.

Other details about her and the job

* She cannot speak in English *(thus cannot seek advice online)*
* She chose this line of work as she cannot code
* She works in the night shift frequently
* Despite 3 years in the team, she only has access to the level of a tester
* She works for the telecom company that offered free internet for a year but she is **employed with a vendor**
* She works in Oracle DBA

&#x200B;

**My questions to the informative folks here are:**

* What are the career prospects in this field?
* How necessary is English to crack interviews or move up the ladder?
* With no appraisal and tester level responsibilites, is she in the crosshairs of the management?
* Does this job get easier with time or more difficult?
* Does one really need little to no internet for work? *(asking just out of curiosity)*
* Lastly, is database management even made for the easy folks like her?",Is my friend not suited for database management?,AskIndia," You can bring a horse to water but cannot make it drink. She seems to have no motivation for money or career improvement. Rest of the questions are pointless, you can get the answers by googling yourself. To me it looks like she is doing some boring manual tasks like taking backups,  running jobs at night etc. These skills have not much transferable values. If she is not interested in coming out, why are you so concerned? 🤪"

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/india) if you have any questions or concerns.* The article also let's you come up with numbers with your estimates of infections or fatality rates. The slider \_doesn't\_ let you increase the fatality rate to 1.5% only which may be missing the entire section of those who died of other diseases during this Covid period, for lack of sufficient healthcare. One can take the ""more likely scenario"" of 20x the reported cases and 0.30% of fatality rate plus add another \~400k more deaths from the non-covid cohort to arrive at 2 million mark.  Feels odd saying that - 2,000,000 dead. 20 lakh.

How does a nation suffer such drastic casualty and still retain its belief in its leaders, its gods, its destiny?

Edit Note: Changed ""The slider let's you"" to ""The slider \_doesn't\_ let you"". Sorry for the typo. This is ~~America~~ India I honestly don't think the infections are this much but the fatalities are. Death toll is double atleast.

nkykuu,"Hello, Apologies that I can't share much personal details here but I will as much as I can.

So if someone has 50lac worth of savings and that's all, no other steady monthly income or job or other investments, what business one can start to have steady income?

Job is not an option and the area of expetise is general stuff, technology friendly and knowledgeable on current affairs and situation. 

Please ask any other specific if you need.

English is not their first language.",What sustainable and good profitable business you can start with 50 lac rs in India?,Business/Finance," If you really have 50 lac just leave this country and settle a good life outside. remindme! 3 days Remindme! 5 days I would first try to plan my finances if 50L is all you have, don't dump it all in your biz, This is not a good place to ask this kinda advice tho but looking at 50L you won't be doing stuff in a big city until you plan for selling some kind of product right-away. I would also suggest you do a good amount of research in multiple sectors, talk to people in that space, look for what kinda scarcity is there in the market. Look out for B2B opportunities (Business to Business) as most of the focus of people is in B2C (Business to Customer) . 

on top of my mind I have things like:

Online Clothing shop

 Mid/Low tier eatery franchise (hugely depends on where you live)

General Store (Again hugely depends on where you live)

if you are spending a big amount, and you don't have any income or anything to support you, make sure you really believe your idea, dont get overly optimistic, be balanced. Again this is not a thing you should be asking on the internet but here's some general advice Buy a mini food truck or buy a normal mini truck and convert it to a food truck. Second hand would be better. Ask someone from your family to help you with cooking and you take care of the logistics supply. Go places and sell your stuff. Schools, colleges, parks etc should be your target."
nkyhap,"So my parents are taking immunity booster meds specifically vitamin c with zinc. They aren't covid positive are anything but they do have moderately high level of sugar 100-140.
But I have seen from news and stuff that the black fungus infection is possible to strike in sugar and zinc rich bodies.
So my question is should I stop them from taking the meds or is it okay it let it be?

Edit:thanks for all the answers",Immunity boosters with zinc?,AskIndia," You are already thinking of fungal infection! Just take total precautions and avoid covid. Make sure no outside visits house at all and get them vaccinated. And keep washing hands especially when outside or coming home from outside. Not really sure about the sugar and zinc correlation. The fungi affects immunocompromised individuals. Their glucose levels aren't high enough to worry about and if otherwise healthy, the risks are minimal. Supplements can be useful if they are deficient. I would suggest to add Vit D3 as due to lockdown, sun exposure is reduced and may cause a deficiency. No harm in taking supplements, the excess is passed out in urine. Vitamin C and zinc are supplements they won't cause any harm to the body until and unless their us some rare issues. (It won't also help a lot with Covid)
Consult a doctor once if there are any issues  I don't think there is any thing to be concerned about. Black fungus is linked to steroids given to COVID-19 infected people. Because steroids suppress immune response , it slows down the response to other kinds of infections..

 If they are not infected they can continue to take supplements. And consult doctor for more clarity. I don't see a clear solution concerning Zinc. Maybe don't take too much. Take 25mg per day or 2 days.

Zn is good against Coronavirus

Zn is bad, helps fungus growth. You can find a few papers if you search ""Mucormycosis zinc chelators"" on how zinc removing chemicals help slow down fungus growth.



----
On a side note, also found papers on Iron chelators helping against Mucormycosis. So make sure no additional iron is taken as part of vitamins. Iron supplementation may not be so essential for good health.

---

some relevant tweets about Zinc and Iron

https://twitter.com/RajeevJayadevan/status/1396031337685942273

https://twitter.com/singhak_endo/status/1389668404575965186 Yeah, you need to limit their dosage... Too much is never good either! 

And To be honest, there is nothing as immunity boosters. Just follow healthy lifestyle. Good food, Proper exercise and enough sleep are three basic things that keep your immunity at maximum level.

And lastly about black fungus, they are definitely not going to get black fungus at home, with enough hygiene and their normal immunity. Plus even if they get infected with Covid-19, Doctors are sensitised these days about regulated usage of steroids and Immunosuppressants. So just stop worrying about Black fungus. Again the possibility of black fungus infection for your parents is very small. Again you should be more worried of them catching covid. please take care.  


Also if you are worried about the zinc, you can try

nktt95,"No one is talking about how the government hasn't removed the gst rates on the vaccine and other such health devices. Understand what this means, it simply means it doesn't matter how much you give as taxes, donations, penalties or whatever the government is always in need of money because of whatever reason. I hate it that people are being forced to pay for the vaccine but I understand its the business of the manufacturer. Why the fuck is the government thinking about taxes over that. And it's not like this is something different. Certain medical services are exempt from GST. Why are the vaccines something so special that they can't exempt it. There are talks about it but why wasn't it done in the first place.

How will we keep getting brainwashed by the BJP IT warriors? we have a history of not caring when the rulers strip us of everything we have We are a generation of lazy fucks who think they are contributing to development or progress in the country by liking/upvoting/retweeting the posts on these digital platforms.

I feel much better now, I regret why I haven't shut them before.

My neighbor uncle is a local BJP politician, earlier he used to tell me all the propogands bs, and I simply listened out of respect and never objected him.

Few days back I abused Modi and BJP so much in front of all the neighborhood, from then he never talk about politics with me again.

I am feeling much better now ✌




Edit 1 : Tanks for your Support and Suggestions

Clarification : I don't fight with anyone, neither my neighbor uncle or my relative. It's just who sets the agenda, earlier they used to set the agenda of conversation.

Earlier they used to tell Modi is doing good, Modi is doing the name of Nation, as I was not some over-hyped political person, I never cared much. I just accepted it ""OK he is doing good""

But now I don't even give them a chance to set any agendas, I simply start the conversation with so much abuses for Modi and BJPigs , they just have to agree with me. This time I am setting the narrative.

With the case of my neighbor uncle, when I started abusing Modi openly many others also approved my sentiments, who were earlier just Yes man.

Not all people are BJP members, majority are just fence sitters who will just go with the winning side.

It's a game of who shout the loudest, if you set the narrative all fence sitters will come to your side.","I broke my Silence, You Should Too ✌",Politics," More power to you. Do it and keep at it. Be respectful to those who you want to keep in your life. Others can get the unsanitized version of your rant.

I don’t know what you mean by “ abuse “ but I would suggest not to resort to name calling. Put your points across in a decent and respectful manner. its time to stand up n support who do, After this 2nd wave negligence, I ,too, am in offensive mode. Our silence have cost too much. Counter their propoganda - but do it in a way that a fence sitter may change their mind The society is not ruined by bad elements of society but by silence of good elements. I have started talking more against BJP to my mom and tried to make her open her mind. She either says something to which I give a strong comeback or doesn't answer. And I play Newslaundry videos on the Smart TV where they satirize Mudiji often so yeah Don't know if this is the correct thing to do, but yeah I have started calling them out on their stupidity and xenophobia. 

The only way we have some hope is to get our families to change their minds (and hopefully their votes). And get their heads our of WhatsApp groups.

nkw4r9,"I am reading about a controversy in the UK about herd immunity. The idea is to let the virus spread and people develop natural resistance so that it does not spike after a certain period. There was serious consideration of this strategy in many countries. In fact Sweden is the country that tried this approach.

So, I was thinking, did Indian government try herd immunity that went out of control or was the spike in pandemic the result of state v/s center politics?","Just curious, hence the question; did the Indian government try the herd immunity option?",Politics," I don't understand, how does herd immunity in Covid work? I mean people get reinfected upon contact. It's not like people who are infected with covid 2-3 times will not get covid. Most probably they will get it abut i guess the intensity would be low. Can someone enlighten? Sweden tried this in first wave...and they failed to some extent So many people would die with this method, and hospitals would have been over run, cause essentially you’re just letting the virus spread, what do you think would happen in a country 1.3 billion people and hospital structures that can’t support that population, unlike Sweden India has a moron who calls himself the PM and thinks he's the master of all trades. So, I'm not surprised he tried it, but real people with blind faith were the guinea pigs and paid the price. itna details mei to nahi socha honga waise bhi gharelu nuske se kaam to chal hi raha hai na"
nkvxd8,"I'm using the term ""liberal"" broadly. I mean social liberalism, a set of [social views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics) on which most ""Liberals"" and ""Left"" intersect. 


I think small groups like this do exist in different places. But they are all doing their own thing. I don't see large groups with sufficient numbers and social capital to act as a pressure group.

It's possible I'm just ignorant about the existence of such groups either nationally or in particular states. 

Are you aware of such societies in your state? Whose vision is a progressive Indian society, who educate society about liberal ideals, who empower underprivileged groups through work / activism / courts, who act as a moral or even emergency support network for one another and for underprivileged sections?",Why haven't liberals organized ourselves? Why aren't there liberal society of India chapters in every state? Or do they exist and most of us just don't know about them?,Politics," I think the IYC head by B V Srinivas is doing a great job.

I’m based in Bangalore as well and willing to join a group if there is one. Liberalism represents a very broad group of political opinions. There are several civil society advocacy groups spread across India. They do come together for movements and causes such as the one against NRC and CAA. AAP was based on these principles but what have they become?

You have to also understand not everyone is ok with giving whole time to activism they have to work and earn.

The very definition of liberal is different for different people, librals living at same economic level would have different opinion about what being a liberal actually means and to this add different economic sections, a rich liberal will have different understanding of libral compared to poor libral.

Even the points that they feel needs immediate attention and resources is very different.

You have to understand that liberals as a whole is a progressive concept and have many dimensions to it, so it is not possible for everyone to come unite under a single platform. The opponent is quite big and organized. It seems quite natural for people of a fair group to be also organized against it. But i think this is quite detrimental to generating new ideas. And we eventually become what we are supposed to stand against. I hope this thought was not very confusing. But this is what i feel. Like it or not, liberals is just a term to refer to people who are anti-BJP. Think of the most conservative Muslim - he has the same set of antiquated opinions like the BJP. Yet he is a liberal because he doesn't support our conservative government.

Unlike BJP where the same thought and mindset prevail across the spectrum, Indian liberals are spread across the entire range. You can't organize them into one group."

Why do Indians always resort to violent and barbaric approaches to make people understand things? Every day is a new low in this country.

nkvalq,,BJP members falsely claim AAP provided COVID relief only to a Muslim doctor’s family,Politics," A bar so low that the party symbol should be changed to a shovel. God damn. Doing Hindu Muslim is the only thing that BJP does best. Now when a chief minister is doing something good for Delhi, BJP has started playing the card of Hindu Muslim to discredit him. Lying is their bread and butter they came to power only by lying every one is seeing Gujarat model in action now. It has come to a point where governments will think twice about being compassionate to a non-hindu. BJP didn't help even one Hindu family? Somebody should call that out in response. BJP is being called out here but Many congress politicians in Delhi try to run with same agenda as well. Where as there is no consideration of religion for something that has been undertaken as a policy by Delhi Government from past 6+ years. And most likely only goverment in India to show this big of a heart. Despite all the roadblocks and shoe string budgets.

Yes at times there may be delays to provide support as slew of checks and balances are performed but no deserving person is denied. Why say, *’BJP members falsely claim’*, when you can get the message across with *’BJP claims’*?"
nkv800,"I'm a 31-year-old guy with very few friends and no relationship. I am feeling lost, lonely, and isolated in this lockdown. I don't feel like working or talking with my friends. The lack of relationship in my life is finally getting to me and I feel like I will be forever alone.

I am aware of my privilege in this pandemic but I can't help but feel despondent and hopeless. I AM NOT FEELING SUICIDAL but I just feel numb.

What can I do to manage these emotions? Would really appreciate your suggestions.",Feeling lonely and isolated in this lockdown. What can I do cull this feeling?,AskIndia," Whenever I feel anything similar, I just give up everything and do what I like. Like watching a new movie, clean my room, code, play games, etc. Just don't think about it much. Its easier said than done but if we keep heeding it, it would haunt even more. Pre-covid I used to go for a walk and just observe people. Seeing them rush and me just sitting under a tree watching them was a different experience. Life is beautiful, sometimes its just what it is and we need to accept it or move way out of our comfort zone to change it. I'll share what I do - For starters, start watching a series to feel engaged. That's what I'm doing - Rewatching breaking bad! 
Other than that, I like listening to music, singing along is such a stress buster! If you like cooking, prepare a fancy ass meal for yourself, treat yourself with a spa day at home or simply order good food! (I call this a date with myself!). And the last thing would be to sleep - I love sleeping - upto 9-10 hours if the temperature and ambience is just right. You can be as lazy as you want. 

Chill, love yourself and have fun by yourself! 

r/lonely isn't a very helpful sub but you'll know that atleast you're not alone in feeling this way.

r/kidsarefuckingstupid and r/babyelephantgifs are cute and funny Grow some plants in a pot or empty plastic bottle.
I grew some in the last lockdown when I was alone for more than 5 months.
Or join any relevant online course. I had this feeling last year stuck in lockdown as my pregnant wife was away at my in laws place far away. And had to miss the child birth too. 
I'm an introvert as well with very few close friends. I started taking walks on empty roads in the morning which was kind of therapeutic looking at morning sky and enjoying nature. I started connecting with nature more. Got a few earthern pots where I used to fill in water and some bird feed for all kinds of birds which suddenly started showing up during lockdown. Later I started growing few plants like chilli, dhaniya, khadi patta etc for cooking. Also, cooking is as good as meditation if you are into it. 

In short, try to connect with nature and discover little things that bring you happiness To get mental health support, connect with therapists through Untangle's (an NGO) CopeWithCovid initiative.

This isn't just a lapse in their security but malicious intent to protect their brand image. 

The addresses available in the database can be used maliciously by bad elements to stalk or harass dominos customers. 

This company doesn't even want to admit how badly they've fucked up. What a horrible piece of shit corporation. Fuck them. I want you all to think about these scenarios to understand how bad this is, even if you have no concern for your privacy. 

1) You get into a fight with someone online. Happens all the time. No biggie, right? Well if they know your name, they'll find your number. If they find your number they now know where you live. You are now in actual danger. Trust me this shit happens all the time anyways. Dominos and the hacker just made it way easier. 

2) You're a girl. You get harassed by people on your phone. You get unwanted whatsapp messages, phone calls, whatnot. Its literally a part of your everyday life as fucking horrible as that might be. It happens a lot. Now that deranged fuck also knows where you live right down to your exact gps coordinates. 

This shit is really really bad. Many people I know are laughing it off but its a huge safety issue and its not being treated like it is by anyone.

nkslhe,,Modi-BJP-RSS meeting was on ‘way to undo damage’ of Yogi govt's Covid handling in UP,Politics," ""Hmm, how can we fool the people of this state more? Any ideas, guys??"" They better not win this time guys m telling you. Lol. As if the Central government did a great job. The ""reported"" daily number of cases in UP have dropped drastically. BJP machinery is making full use of this to build a narrative about the excellent ""Uttar Pradesh model"" of COVID management. Previously when you used to search ""Yogi Adityanath"", you would get news articles about love jihad, Muslims being arrested, NSA, sedition cases etc. But now all you find are fluff pieces such as how WHO praised the UP government for its Covid-19 testing strategy (which was [debunked](https://scroll.in/article/995026/fact-check-no-who-did-not-praise-the-up-government-for-its-covid-19-testing-strategy)). There are 9 months left before UP goes to polls, if BJP can turn this around within that time and win, there's really no hope for us in 2024. 

By 2024, I believe COVID will not be as big a factor any more, the economy will probably still not recover completely and unemployment will be high, but as we have already seen in the 2019 general elections when the economy [was at a 42 year low](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2020/01/10/india-has-worst-economy-in-42-years-is-prime-minister-modi-watching/) and unemployment [at a 45 year high](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/1/31/india-unemployment-rate-highest-in-45-years-report), that doesn't matter. lol even they admit Aditya ka damage at least Would be fun if they replace yogi. Would be a civil war situation. I am fairly certain they would lose UP with him as candidate. It is easy winning when its Modi vs Akhilesh + Rahul, like in 2017, Yogi on the other hand, not so much. His government has done enough damage to make poor eastern UP belt and lower castes to not vote for BJP anymore. 1. Ban drones.

2. Arrest everyone who did not die yet yes because what's more important for a government than winning elections lol..have they any, i mean even an iota of sympathy for people who died, or these people live only to win elections and enjoy power?

nkrjll,"Dear randians,

  
I am looking to buy a reflector telescope. I saw some comments here, which recommended startracker.  I have spoken to them and they recommend me the below models  


[http://tejraj.com/st-114900-eq-telescope.html](http://tejraj.com/st-114900-eq-telescope.html)

[https://tejraj.com/st-114900az1.html](https://tejraj.com/st-114900az1.html)

  
Can someone please suggest me other alternatives or let me know if this the best i can buy in a budget of around 15k.  


Please let me know what you think.  


Thanks!",Hello r/indians please help me buy a telescope,Science/Technology," I'm an Astrophotographer and someone who's been obsessed about Astronomy and Space since I was 8 years old so hopefully I can shed some light on this, since I'm struggling with the same dilemma for years now.

My first question is: Why do you want a Telescope? What are you expecting out of it? If you're thinking you can see bright colorful nebulae from it, then that's simply not possible. At most you can see a colorless faint cloud in the Sky. Same with Galaxies. [Probably something like this](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bef45eb0badeb0d6544b2b21ef7903df)

Next, let's take planets from our Solar System. Even the smallest and cheapest telescope is enough to make you see Jupiter. [It will look really small, but it's possible](https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*kX7a082oFy5fxjJeI0OfaQ.jpeg). On perfect, moonless, windless nights, you might even be able to make out the rings of Saturn. And of course, our own Moon will be visible in pristine quality with lots and lots of craters in high detail.

And....that's about it. No details on Mars. Venus and Mercury are just big spotlights, and all the other remaining planets will be barely distinguishable from the background stars. 

Anything more than that? You WILL have to spend more. At least around 1 lakh range for a proper EQ Scope and Mount.

My suggestion: Instead of buying a telescope, if you already have a DSLR, buy a telephoto lens, and a [DSLR Star Tracker](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MifF2fC6smvSm6TGSZpe8N-1200-80.jpg). It rotates your camera as the same rate as the Earth's rotation on its axis which means you can take really long shutter exposures and end up with some really really good photos. A star tracker will cost around 30-40K but in my opinion it's better value for money.

Other suggestion: If your budget is set at 15K, buy a nice binocular instead. It will be cheaper than a Telescope of a comparable power, and you can still see things like the Moon and Jupiter with it.

What I do: I only have a cheap and small [Celestron 60 AZ](https://www.amazon.in/Celestron-PowerSeeker-60AZ-Telescope-Black/dp/B0002CTZAC) telescope with me. I bought in 2014 or something and I outgrew it years ago. It's basically just a prop in my photos these days. I also cannot afford a big telescope or even a DSLR tracker, so I did what most Indians do in such situations- Jugaad. I learned a technique called 'stacking' where you take multiple images of the same subject with just a DSLR (not using the telescope) and then merge all those photos together using computer Software.

Just to give you a taste, [these](https://np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/jlswsy/1_vs_3000_i_couldnt_afford_a_telescope_or_a/) are [the type](https://np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/jlswsy/1_vs_3000_i_couldnt_afford_a_telescope_or_a/) of [images](https://np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/kp91ph/1_vs_4000_i_couldnt_afford_a_telescope_or_an/) I have [taken](https://np.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/j3ty70/6_year_progress_with_the_exact_same_cheap/) in the [last 5 years](https://np.reddit.com/r/spaceporn/comments/hc06yz/1_vs_240_most_of_the_milky_way_shots_we_see_have/) or so.


I hope this may have helped you in clearing up some of the confusion, and hopefully now you'll be able to decide better on what _your_ specific priorities are. Personally speaking, I'm saving money in order to be able to buy a EQ motorized scope + Telescope for around 50-60 K one day. But I won't be observing things directly from it. I'll be attaching my camera and using the scope essentially as a very long zoom lens to take better images out of it. That's the plan anyway.

Hope all this helped. Do ask if you have any other question"

Do they call him an uneducated idiot and a charlatan? No. Do they say ""He should get a real job instead of using quack, backwards, third world practices?"" No.

Instead, Indian doctors say

>comments by Baba Ramdev have hurt our sentiments

and beg

>Baba Ramdev is an excellent yoga teacher and practitioner. Yog is a way of life! He should stick to yoga. Please leave medicine practice to us.

How utterly pathetic. Tell us more about how your precious feelings are hurt and how you're crying yourself to sleep.

Don't these people have any self-respect and backbone? If even the section of society that's as venerated and educated as doctors act like little pussies, the whole country has no hope.","Indian doctors being ""hurt and upset"" by the yoga guru insulting modern medicine shows you just doomed India is.",Non-Political," Because

A) they value their lives 

B) doctors can't really do things like go on strike for long. They have an oath which they abide by. Good doctors are never going to use their skills as leverage to gain the upper hand in anything. All they can do is make their vote count. Doctors don't want NSA or UAPA 

OR even worse mob lynching Ramdev is acting like a pharma company. He just want to sell his products at the expense of people's life. They don't want to get lynched by Ramdev's followers, that's why. Indian doctors cannot come out saying stupid and crass shit, it's called dignity. Aaj kal sabko lagta hai unless you're shouting or giving maa behen ki gaali, you are not serious. Surely you live in the same country as the rest of us. Doctors aren’t rich businessmen who run the govt by proxy. They are already busy being assaulted by irate patient relatives who believe doctors are monsters. Also ramdev is getting so much mileage and no censure by the govt because his funds help bjp stay in power. Talking to him rudely will invite the wrath of the state machinery.

Edit- just realised you dont live in india. All manner of charlatans and fakesters are taking over the country. Right from the top to the bottom, all of them are anti intellectual, anti-education assholes. They dont understand how things work at all instead depending on the shit stew they have been fed all their life in the name of culture. What is this obsession with getting ""hurt & upset"".

Ramdev is demonstrably WRONG. He should be accused/charged with LYING. There is no need to get ""emotions"" in the discussion when discussing facts. Whatever, lalaji has all the ministers and ministries at his disposal. 

But really i am amazed to see lalaji have been able to mock entire medical community in India and get away with it laughing. And then raised challenges..

Not only medicos, lalaji is real threat to all educated and rational Indians. Narcissistic behaviour is widespread and acceptable now. Yep,we have no hope left"
nkraiv,,"I captured this beautiful little bird in Pune city. It is as cute as its name, Strawberry Finch.",Art/Photo (OC)," I am going to ignore all the comments and say.
That bird is a ruthless killer and needs an action movie. This is a Red Avadavat, also known as the Strawberry Finch because of the beautiful strawberry like coloration of the males. The females are not colourful. It's a small sparrow sized bird found in tropical Asia, however it has been introduced in many other places across the world as a result of pet trade (its not a good sign, because outside its native range, it becomes an invasive species). It breeds in the Indian Subcontinent during the monsoons. 
I captured this beautiful male in Pune city, Maharashtra.

Checkout my Instagram (@ks_wild) for more of my photos, videos and stories about Nature and Wildlife Sorry, but got scared when glanced at the bird's eyes. Seems like its eyes are bloodshot. very beautiful... and very good focus What a handsome guy😍 That's a stunning shot, shall check your Instagram for sure. Where in Pune did you find it? ARAI? Great shot. I've seen some of your other stunning pics too. Do you have to go to far-off places or are these beautiful birds visible from your balcony? Also, can you please mention the gear that you used and pic details like focal length etc.? I want to see this as an anime protagonist. Beautiful colors! Is this bird local to Pune/Maharashtra? Or a migratory one with seasonal stop in Pune? Awesome pic.

Not if you are not expecting to cross >20 lacs in yearly income. 

Also, from a business growth perspective: 

1. Handicraft is a community+socially driven market - see if that can work out for you
2. You can't use traditional marketing to grow it without incurring huge costs
3. Speak with 100 target customers first - and narrow down from there
4. Remember, word of mouth is very high in this segment, work on optimizing word of mouth Handicraft ? Get on Etsy bro.
Target the gore log.
Indians won't buy handicraft. Open a rope store. And then open a stool store beside the rope store. Instagram, WhatsApp, FB provide a decent initial platform to sell as they have good traffic. Work as a proprietor no need to register a company before good sales. Focus on marketing and selling, and not on tech right now.           
Later if you get the traction you can use Shopify to create your own e-commerce store.      
If you want direct payments and don't want to share with the platform use Instamojo's payment links.         
You need nothing else."

nkr1p0,"Which Breed is your Dog?

How do you deal with your neighbors?

Does your dog bark excessively? How do you cope with that?

Please do share your Stories.","Dogs owners who live in an Apartment/Flat in India, What are the Common problems you face?",AskIndia," My dog is an Indian street dog I adopted as a puppy. We have lived both in a traditional house and a flat. Some major problems are lack of space and neighbors who can be annoyed. I actually got kicked out of my last flat because my downstairs neighbour complained that my dog howls once in a while and that is ""not a good omen."" He also told me my dog was not a ""good dog"" and at the end, called police on me but my landlord intervened and didn't let them do anything. Also this was back in March 2020 when the lockdown was getting started.

Currently, I still live in another flat with my dog. It's a pretty big flat and me and the dog live alone here so we have plenty of space. Neighbours are also dog-lovers thankfully and I work from home so I can ensure she's always well behaved. When I used to leave, I would ensure she gets enough exercise beforehand and then feed her a little so she would naturally fall asleep when I leave.

As for barking excessively, that depends on the training. Dogs will bark naturally to loud noises and you cannot avoid that but my pup is trained to shut the fuck up the moment I tell her to so most of the time there's only a single loud ""BHOWW"" once in a while.

Lastly, it's important to take care of the dog's health by regulating diet and exercise. Just because your dog looks at you cutely doesn't mean you overfeed it or give it human food that will make her sick in the long run. 

Throughout all this, I have never thought about abandoning her and never will. Dogs in flats might get limb problems I've heard Indie. Took her in as a puppy from the streets. She hardly barks, not even if someone is at door. That's her nature, we didn't do anything to make her like that. 

My husband trained her. She knows she's not supposed to run if the door opens, she's not supposed to jump on people. Knows basic commands like sit, come, stay, no. This helps a lot when kids and other dogs are around because she's very friendly and wants to play with everyone. We also short leash her when there are a lot of people around. She has her crate, two beds and lots of toys. Invest in toys only if they're interested in them and buy only the toys they like.

We've only lived in flats with her. Never had any complaints about her being noisy but my old neighbours would complain to my in-laws (when we were at office) that she wasn't ""auspicious"". I hated them. We've moved now and our new neighbours are really nice. Fuck dog owners, I get shit for feeding strays, cant believe that was possible. thank heavens I'm huge and muscular so I square up and really aggressively handle the situation with an undertone of violence even when faced with 3 to 4 people, now they have to give me way when I'm feeding else they know I'll choose violence.

I'm an animal lover and I've seen what happens to the nice ones so I can't take a chance here, also I started collecting my house vegetable waste and the neighbour's and first feed 3 to 4 cows daily with that so I'm well covered, no one's gonna give me shit even though I bash religion every chance I get. I live in a large flat. Three big problems that I managed to solve:

1. Area for my dogs to run around
2. Issues with tiles and subsequent leg problems
3. Idiotic neighbours

\#1 - I love my dogs, and got rid of flashy/unnecessary furniture. I can understand that this isn't something that's a luxury not available to everyone, but my dogs are my babies :) They can run around freely throughout the house. We also maintain a public park where we usually meet (pre-pandemic) in morning and evenings. It's a large space where our dogs can play together. I maintain this park (including cleaning, removing weed, etc).

\#2 - I got rugs that have a rubber underlining that makes them stick to the tiles and my dogs can run on top of it. My entire floor is covered with those rugs. They are not very cheap (\~4k per rug I think) and a decent sized room would need 4-5 of them I think. They are very helpful though. Only issue is with cleaning them.

\#3 - You have to understand, you owe no one anything. Dogs are legally allowed and it's illegal to ban them anywhere. Now, you also have to look into the type of society you live in (co-operative vs service), service societies can't do shit and they are only allowed to maintain a property. IPC is above everyone here. But if your neighbour is still being an Ahole, contact Maenka Gandhi on her email, her team will that person (provide address and contact number of your neighbour) and they'll take care of it. If your neighbour works in a govt job, trust me, they will shake after this call.

**Dogs barking** is not an issue. It's their nature. For sure, you can try to calm them, but like humans, dogs do have their own personality. Can't change it and don't be worried/embarrassed by it. Me and my friends raised a golden retriever in a flat in Bangalore. Since you want to know about problems 

1. The flooring of flats is generally not good for dogs as it is a bit slippery resulting in less grip. This eventually could leave to bone structural problem.

2. If there no sufficient space for in apartment(garden, terrace, basement), your dogo could become chonky and lazy which many would consider unhealthy.

3. Flats generally are less spacious so your doggo won’t have enough area to explore and play around on. 

One would have to put extra effort in flat compared to multi-storey houses. Just my point of view though. You should consider all options as per your situation and give a good thought if you are planning to be responsible for a life. Not allowed to cook. The number of people who tolerate spoiled noisy children but act as if your dog is barking 24/7, pets are one of the best ways to pick on neighbours. Don't like a neighbour? Complain about pet to association. The number of abandoned pets is directly related to people moving into apartments"
nkqs6h,"It has been 29 days since I was tested positive. I was admitted to the hospital on day one, right when I got Covid positive results. The hospital I was in had little to no hygiene because everyone shared a single humidifier.

I'm 20 years old and don't have diabetes or any issue related to Immunodeficiency and while I was at home I was never given any steroid.

Do I really have ""Fungus"" disease? The only thing i'm having issues is with my bottom incisor teeth and sometimes my molar teeth hurt as well.

Then had to go through four teeth extraction because all my wisdom teeth were completely fucked. 

It's vital to get dental care early to save the tooth. if you have no other options like going to doc or getting an xray ,

try changing to a high fat low/zero carb diet like keto.

the reason is it's good for teeth (bacteria cannot grow easily in mouth) and good against  glucose craving fungal infections

some of my tooth pains related to small infections vanish whenever I have started high fat diets with low carbs


There is another alternative  .. use chlorhexidine containing tooth paste like [Elgydium anti plaque](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/elgydium-anti-plaque-tooth-paste-150gm-29187). Good against pains caused by bacteria on surface of teeth. Not for fungus though"

Its almost 3 years to the general election of 2024. The Ram Mandir and the spanking new Central Vista will be ready by then. Think of the emotional outpour on Ram Mandir ! Add to that the numerous card they have at their disposal to swipe. Communal card, Hindus are in danger-card, threat to the national security-card, Pakistan-card....etc. Add to that the massive PR machinery at work 24x7...and even after all this, if they percieve that things are still not going their way, they can be really desperate. Well I'm gonna do my part.

As far as I can tell BJP has pissed off artists, students, farmers, IAS officials, doctors, bankers, journalists and some of their own supporters.

We have seen how resilient farmers have been in their protests, even drawing international attention.

The govt is has burned a lot of bridges, unemployment and poverty are at an all time high. It has pissed off every minority and a portion of the majority, so if can't be united now, we never will in the future.

If you're in any of these categories then don't think you're alone, or underestimate the strength in unity. 

We can and we will denounce this current regime, as long as you do your part. Raat jaayegi baat jaayegi will happen in 2024. That's India's motto ever since. I lost my father in this second wave. I'll never forget 2022: Couple of movies to scratch the Hindu Pride itch

Please someone update what reply government gives. Also, no deadline was mentioned in the article for the government to respond. 

This issue alone could have saved atleast 100-200 lives as even doctors say not many come back from the ventilator stage. So we are talking about thosands of ventilators here and hence atleast a few hundred people saved. This issue must be dealt with like a murder case of 100 people. Bhakts who complained why courts take such long holidays now wish they take more vacation Interested to see how the government will reply to the HC!! you can see yesterdays Prime Time with Ravish, he says some of ventilator didnt had some part fitted, some didnt had fuse which cost 5/10 INR . 

this govt need to drag to court need to ask account of PMcares fund Action against PMO or Fodiji? Procured sub standard stuff in haphazard manner, focused on quantity instead of qualify, what more can you expect when every work needs to be done for PR purpose only, ventilator are sophisticated equipment, installation and commission may take time ..

I want to gift a decent Android phone to my parents.

What are some good recommendations? Budget is 15,000 INR per phone.

Few points need to focus on:

1. After sales service  
2. Durability since our parents tend to handle things little roughly
3. Battery life
4. Hardware issues like camera, water resistance, heating, etc.",Android phone recommendation to gift parents?,AskIndia," Samsung M or A series (reliable and not as feature packed - but parents don’t need that many features)

Mi phones (feature packed but not as reliable as Samsung) You can look into realme phones Get the Samsung M31 or a Redmi Note 10 (Regular variant is enough). Disable the ads/unwanted notifications. There are guides to do them on YouTube if you have any difficulty. Realme 7 - very good overall package, 90hz screen, 15k

Poco M2 Pro - Similar to Realme7 but with a 60hz display, still a very good phone, 13k

These both have very good battery life (5000 mah)

Poco X3 - Slightly chonkier,  but even larger battery (6000mah) and a 120hz display, also 15k. Probably the most feature packed here if the chonk isn't a problem.

If you can cough up an extra 1k, Redmi Note 10 Pro is insane value for money (120hz Amoled plus the usual)
(Non pro version also not bad, has a slower processor+60hz)

All of these have processors around 732/720g (midrange CPUs, very good performance), and good cameras too.

Poco M3- If you don't mind compromising both on display (60hz) and a slower processor (sd662) to save a buck (11k). (But you get a large 6000mah battery albeit with slower 18wcharging instead of the 33w of others)

If you buy any of these phones, make sure to debloat/ remove ads. Pm if you want more details. I recently gave my mother Nokia 5.4. Clean, stock UI, good battery, not too large or heavy. Could have done with a full HD screen and better processor but she is not playing any games, just YouTube, few streaming apps and occassionally Facebook, WhatsApp, Amazon. 
Serves good for the need.

Looked at Samsung and others but I didn't like the design or they they too large. Wanted to avoid Mi. Motorola has become very generic nowadays. Also, the Nokia 5.4 Dusk is an eye catcher. Looks elegant. Always get a android one phone
Motorola
Nokia
Micromax new mobile Though I use Redmi and other brands, a Samsung low-end smart phone model has worked very well for my parents. Before Samsung, mom had some other new-ish brand that she couldn't get used to. So my advise is to go for some sturdy Nokia or Samsung with less features. Please don't buy Samsung, bloated af Redmi note 10 Redmi note 10S Don't buy an Indian product tho it really has bad quality because i am typing from one and has bad battery and even the design and build quality is pretty bad."

To put it in Hindi. 

“जैसा राजा वैसी प्रजा”  ( translation the people will tend to behave similar to how the king behaves.)

The PM announced victory over Corona, the public believed. The fault lies with the supreme leader. 

We have been distracted enough!!! 

Not anymore. India is a parliamentary democracy only in theory. Ground reality is that we vote for ""supreme leaders"" both in Assembly and in Lok Sabha elections instead of local MLAs and MPs. As such we act as citizens of a presidential system.

The US system works not only because of its presidential system but also because of its clear demarcation and separation of powers between the executive and the elected congress.

As far as demanding accountibility is concerned, it is not done because we often act as subjects than citizens. Furthermore, while there may be freedom in seeking accountibility (although it has been diluted to a great deal in the last few years), there is no freedom ""after"" demanding accountibility.

Yet, if you still have to choose.


Covishield is now WHO recommended. With a lots of data backing it. It can ramp up it's production too.

Covaxin data work is only 90% complete. WHO approval can take 1 more month. Plus it's production capacity is low. I had the same discussion with my friends and everybody was inclined towards Covid shield as it is approved in multiple countries. Covishield in the current options. But if there is a chance and availability, i will go for pfizer. Covishield due to international recognition for traveling. 

Else you will be subject to extra quarantine measures for at least a couple of years more. Took covidsheild. Had better and wider testing behind it (since its AsterZeneca). Would recommend Pfizer if available for the same reasons as above. Covaxin isn't approved by any country other india right now as far as I know. Best to get covishield since it's recognised and approved by a lot of countries, even better to get pfiezer because covishield is known to cause blood clots, especially in younger people.   
  
Getting covaxin might lead you in a situation where you cannot travel to another country (say USA) since they don't recognise the vaccine and india will refuse to give you a shot of covishield since you've already gotten one shot of covaxin....best to avoid this possible clusterfuck and get whatever vaccine the first world is getting covidshield coz it is approved by WHO. covaxin for better strain resistance.

but for international travel obligation get covisheild. Would prefer Covishield since it's WHO approved , I think it would be acceptable for international travel requirements if I have to . Saying that I will get any first offered.
I am skeptical about sputnik at this point since Russia is closely controls vaccine data. My preference would be Moderna > Pfizer > astra zenaca > covishield (it's basically same as astra zenaca) > covaxine > sputnik.

I live in UK and my vaccine slot is next week. Most probably they would administer moderna or astra zenaca

Edit: I would like to add a caveat in the indian context. For india I'd prefer the vaccine that has the least complicated storage and transport requirements. Because you really don't know whether proper care was taken in its transport or storage. Considering the number of power cuts we have been having even in major cities like pune, I'm not sure that a vial of a vaccine like Pfizer would even be effective by the time i receive it."

Give it to people who are willing to take Okay, the good solution would be quell the misinformation by nipping it at the root and catching anyone spreading misinformation under the disaster management act. At the same time, spread awareness about the vaccine. Hell, Give cash rewards for vaccinations if that needs to be done.

If even after all this, if they don't want to take the vaccine, leave them to their own devices with a warning. These vaccines would be better utilised in a community which wants to do their part in keeping the pandemic at bay. oh no !

This fungus does not spread like covid, and only affects those with uncontrolled sugar, either due to diabetes or use of steroids. They also have to have used oxygen apparatus with unclean water.

nkntua,"Hello. About two weeks ago, my partner attempted sucide and fortunately survived. However, understandably so, getting back to the normal is incredibly hard for her and whilst she is getting help by a group of professionals, I was wondering if there is any group/forum/platform out there which could be useful for her. 
Any kind of leads would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.",Is there an active online community/forum exclusively dedicated to sucide attempt surviors?,AskIndia," If you're in Bangalore I think there might be support groups. Not sure though. Online support groups don't have a leader or any moderation, so it often ends up being very toxic; that's just my 2 cents. 

Source- I have bipolar disorder. It isnt the same problem but I think the principle applies. 

Maybe your partner's therapist will know of offline support groups, and I hope she gets better soon.

Sorry I hope this helps. Please don't join any online communities or forums. In my experience they tend to be toxic. Generally, healing or support isn't at forefront. Mental health isn't like cancer or diabetes. It actually screws with your thought patterns and processes. Trying to heal oneself while reading about similar or worse situations is not going to help. At worst it might increase suicidal ideation.

I remember asking doctors at NIMHANS if there are any offline communities for people with bipolar and they told me no. So, I think the possibility of a community for suicide attempt survivors is going to be even less.

My personal advice would be that she not bond with other suicidal people over this experience. I'm not minimising her experience, it is in fact very important she share it, but only with a trained professional.

Right now she's recovering from a traumatic experience. Try and keep things simple and structured. Focus on building a schedule. No skipping medication or sessions with therapists. Also, limit use of social media/internet and binge-watching TV shows or films. If she's meeting a therapist she'll be asked to do some activities. She can do those in her free time.

nknq5w,,Youtuber booked In Arunachal for racist remarks against MLA over BGMI,Non-Political," Good.

People need to stop referring to Indians as Chinese just because they look different. These Youtubers influence so many kids who then do the same thing. Indians are racist as fuck, it's time some action be taken against more influential ones. 

Maybe that'll give a message to people who follow them When I first joined my college in the south, they would call me Chinese and of my hostel mate asked me to see if I had an adhaar card to prove I'm Indian. Despite me telling her multiple times I'm an indian from northeast she'd call me chinese oh man. I despise people like her. Very good... appreciate it..youtube should block his channel also It is so upsetting so  these news

It really makes my blood bold when people compare others and judge them on the basis of looks and I believe that this racist behavior has destroyed our peace and stability.

I have seen this racist behavior right now I am in Bhopal and when I was in school in my class there was one guy from Assam people made fun of him and called him ""china"" even the teachers! my class teacher also called his own student ""china"".

but I see where this guy is coming from because I was born in Jalandhar, Punjab, and If I am being honest if my dad didn't take my education seriously and if he didn't make the effort to take me away from bad schools and toxic environments my mind would have been just as racist and hateful. my dad was from a very poor and backward family he worked and struggle ass off for his job in the military. the majority of his postings were in the northeastern states and we had a lovely time there if fact he gave the biggest birthday party when I was 2 years old in Assam he invited everyone from his unit even the CO.

and look don't think I am trying to save that guy's ass. I didn't even know he existed. I don't like the fact people are abusing him sending threats to his family isn't and in my opinion he is just young and naive he probably doesn't know the history of the northeastern state and just saying few people know about their history in states like Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, etc.

listen ruining one guy's career banning him off social media will not change anything the change has to happen at the school level. and I believe education and empathy is the only way India can change for good.

edit: and I am sorry If you think I am being hurtful. I am sorry.  I had to say this. This is highly hypocritical. The North East people leave no chance to call any Bengali Muslims as miyas or Bangladeshis. And for them to feel offended when they face racism elsewhere is laughable. Invite this idiot for a trip to Arunachal Pradesh.

He needs to see more beautiful parts of his country. This guy acted smart just to get YouTube points. But I think he should be forgiven after he finishes reading a Indian geography book from page to page.

This guy didn't seem evil or racist ..just extremely extremely poorly educated. Even while making that Chinese comments he said."" I don't know"" but went on with it.


This is what lack of education does, only if he knew so much of Indian culture comes from northeast and such a great example of human beings they are... But no, he was hearing about AP for the first time."
nknppt,"So in short India has run me over. The system and society has punctured my optimism and excitement in 1.5 year and I am in process of returning back. Not planning for US, my employer is ready to re-hire me but now I want to be at some place where I can get PR easily, not wait in decades of queue which people born in India have.

My PR for Canada is in initial stages. Since things are slow right now due to COVID including immigration, so hopefully in next Provincial draw (maybe next month) of Ontario my profile is picked. But it would still take 10 to 12 months for the entire process.

But I have also received an admit from a Canadian university for PhD, September 2021. So seriously considering that option, as I want to be out ASAP and let the PR process go in parallel. But not sure if that would impact my chances of getting student permit, or if I get student permit it would impact my PR application.

The best solution is to wait for PR thing to work out- which it eventually will in next 10 to 12 months. But kind of getting really depressed in India. Cannot focus on work at all, earlier I used to be so excited about work when I lived in US. Sometimes have difficulty sleeping too, and cannot sleep for long. Get very broken sleep. The issue is not work, as work I am doing is completely in-line with my education and what I like to do. I have been living in India at home since I came last year, hardly have any friends nearby. Most of the friends I have, well I cannot connect with them at all. 

So what should I do - wait for the PR thing to work out and try to be as calm as I can be for next 10 to 12 moths. Or just escape for now in next 3 months, and leave PhD when PR things works out. Thank you. ","Lived in US for 10 years and came back to India due to some for family reasons. However, the way things are here, extremely depressed and in process of application for Canadian PR. Also, got admit in PhD at a Canadian University for September 2021. Should I wait for Canadian PR or leave?",AskIndia," If you have enough points(450+) then wait for PR.

But if you think you no longer can survive then run. Leave. Dont look back, just leave. Dont expect any PR applications from outside Canada to be processed this year.
They are only doing CEC for last 5 months as offices are closed in the world and there is already a backlog.

Go for PhD. If and when you get PR, you will be eligible for domestic benefits and fees etc from that term. 

Also student visa wont affect PR and PR application wont affect student visa.

PhD is a long term commitment, so no point wasting a year pondering over it, if you really wanna do it. GET THE F OUT OF THIS S-HOLE Leave fella , India's literally turning into ""Get out "" , the 2017 movie .. Go and take me with you lmao. So jealous you have the option I can’t wait to be done with my ug and immigrate somewhere in the west I applied for my Canadian PR in 2015 and left for my Masters in the same year. It had no impact on me getting a student visa, and I got my PR 2 months after I finished my Masters. I would recommend going for the PHD program. I had also received my admit for Masters in Canada last year. I was waiting for some other ways to apply for pr but considering the situation right now the easiest way to PR in Canada is through Canadian education. So , started my master online hear in India as i had nothing to do and now waiting for the flights to reopen to get out of this country as soon as possible. Go for your education. There are no proper timelines for new ITA`s and even if you get an ITA in a month or so  you are looking at more than a year processing time.

Harvest festival (mostly mid January).

Local festival (depends on the region). When I was growing up this we called this an 'exhibition'. About every year or so they'd take over a large open space and set up a Ferris wheel and other rides, food stalls, performers and whatnot. There's an Urdu word for it too which I can't remember right now. But these are purely commercial amusement events, nothing to do with farming etc. But it's the closest thing you'll see in India, just at a much smaller scale than the typical State Fair in the US.

1. They hate Muslims so much that they have become Hindu Talibaan
2. They hate China so much, so now they are going to censor social media like China. No, FB isn't going anywhere. Just read an article on this sub about IT rules made in Feb which asks social platforms to basically give data regarding users to the govt if they want it. They can also take down your posts and such.

Not surprisingly, the platform that already complies with these rules is the Koo app.

FB has also agreed. Anyway, kinda depressing to see how quickly it takes a democracy to turn into whatever this is now. Probably witnessing history taking a left turn.

Fml I have a feeling they'd ban for a few days to cause a major distraction. No?

They won't be banned at all lmao, it will make the already terrible PR shitstorm even worse.

They aren't that stupid, and besides, OTT streaming platforms like Amazon and Netflix haven't complied with the regulations past THEIR deadline and yet, I'm still able to watch Marvelous Ms Maisel lmao."

nkmb9r,"Hi all,

I was planning on buying a [Jawa 42](https://www.jawamotorcycles.com/motorcycles/42) as I plan on going long distance riding once the lockdown ends and inter district travel begins.

My only motivation in buying this is that it is suitable for short riders (I am 5ft 3). I currently ride a 2013 FZ and face difficulty in setting both feet down at the same time. The 42 is shorter than the FZ with foot rests which are not too far ahead so as to facilitate shorter riders. From reviews, it seems that the RE meteor 350 is more refined than the Jawa 42. However, it is as tall as the 2013 FZ and is also heavier than the 42 so it will be difficult for me to manage it.

### Tl;dr

In Part 7 of the #DataProtectionTop 10 series, we discuss the provisions in the Bill which enable the State to engage in surveillance of the people. Clause 35 of the Bill gives blanket exemption to the State from the application of the Bill on the grounds of national security. This blanket exemption without any sound oversight and review mechanism raises concerns of abuse of power by the State. Hence, we recommend that a chapter on surveillance reforms be inserted in the Bill.

### Background

https://preview.redd.it/7vkdtviwm8171.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e90cfd1d0c7b29f402298d0c1b10f179e828d1c

Last week we discussed how voluntary verification of social media accounts leads to data maximisation, and is a threat to informational privacy of users ([**Part 5**](https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-voluntary-social-media-verification/)) and how local storage of the data creates roadblocks to the free flow of data and debilitates the open nature of the internet ([**Part 6**](https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectionttop10-data-localisation-a-threat-to-free-and-open-internet/)). In today’s post we unpack the most debated issue with the will: the exemptions granted to the State for surveillance.  

Security of the State and law enforcement have historically been a grey area and a stranglehold of the State, which it uses as a shield for surveilling its people. For example, India got its own monitoring program; the Central Monitoring System after the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attacks, [**since a need was felt for greater coordination between law enforcement and security agencies**](https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-2-the-centralised-monitoring-system/) in order to protect the security of the country.  Currently, India has a host of surveillance programs, both in operation as well as in the pipeline, like the [**Centralised Monitoring System (CMS)**](https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-2-the-centralised-monitoring-system/), [**The National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID)**](https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-part-1-the-national-intelligence-grid/), [**Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System (CCTNS)**](https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-part-3/), [**National Automated Facial Recognition System (NAFRS**](https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-4-the-national-automated-facial-recognition-system/)) etc. What is most striking is that there are no comprehensive or robust surveillance laws in the country to effectively check the working of these projects. All we have are a [**few provisions**](https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-2-the-centralised-monitoring-system/) under the The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, and the Rules made under these statutes.

Section 5 sub-section 2 of The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 deals with interception of communications. In times of public emergency or in the interest of public safety the government may order for the interception of communications such as your phone calls if it is satisfied that it is ‘necessary or expedient’ to do so in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State etc. A similar (probably broader) provision for interception, decryption and monitoring of our  activities on the internet is contained in section 69 of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000. Section 69B of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, on the other hand deals with surveillance of traffic data such as the IP addresses, location, the time, date and duration of communications etc. These provisions are supplemented by the Rules: [**Rule 419A of Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007**](https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/march2007.pdf) and the [**Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009**](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28Procedure%20and%20Safeguards%20for%20Interception%2C%20Monitoring%20and%20Decryption%20of%20Information%29%20Rules%2C%202009.pdf), and [**Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Monitoring and Collecting Traffic Data or Information) Rules, 2009**](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28Procedure%20and%20Safeguards%20for%20Interception%2C%20Monitoring%20and%20Decryption%20of%20Information%29%20Rules%2C%202009.pdf). In addition to these sections and the Rules framed thereunder, the license agreements between the Department of Telecommunications and telecom service providers require telecom service providers to assist the government in conducting surveillance.

### Issues: Overbroad exemptions and no safeguards

https://preview.redd.it/qjdzol5xm8171.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a8538d7bf9833b75bba73a428561e268579fc0e

The main issues with these provisions are that a) they do not provide for an oversight mechanism for surveillance and b) that there is no review of the order for surveillance. The orders are issued by the executive and oversight of implementation of these orders, if any, is also by the executive. The current laws on surveillance in India are fraught with/suffer from several legal and procedural infirmities and pave the path to the rise of a surveillance State. It is thus imperative for us to examine whether the Personal Data Protection Bill ameliorates the concerns around the existing regime for surveillance.

When the new draft of the Bill came in 2019, everyone wanted to see what the fate of the section on exemptions that granted the State significant discretionary power to exempt its agencies from any provisions of the Bill would be. It was however quite shocking to see that the Bill confers more power than ever to the State for surveillance.

The power of the Central Government to conduct surveillance is contained in clause 35 of the Bill. Clause 35 enables the Central Government to exempt by order any agency of the government from all or any provisions of the Bill. The order under clause 35 is passed in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, or to prevent incitement to the commission of an offence. The only safeguard given here again is that the order should be in writing and it should contain the reasons for the exemption.

The issues with clause 35 are very patent. The provision is very vague and broad to grant the State unfettered access to personal data without adequate safeguards.  The Bill replaces the established principles of ‘necessity and proportionality’ with ‘necessity or expediency’, which allows the leeway to enact lower standards of protection. The State can exempt any of its agencies by passing an executive order and these orders are not subject to any review. Moreover, it is left to the State to prescribe the procedure, safeguards and oversight mechanism to be followed by the agency exempted from the Bill. This provision is a flagrant violation of the natural principle of justice- ‘no one shall be a judge in his own cause’.

The power of the State to exempt any agency of the State on very flexible grounds such as public order, or prevention of incitement to the commission of an offence by a mere executive order further increases the power of the State to surveil us. This dangerous provision can actualize our fears of the State turning into an ‘[**Orwellian State**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/personal-data-protection-bill-can-turn-india-into-orwellian-state-justice-bn-srikrishna/articleshow/72483355.cms?from=mdr)’. For instance, we have previously explained the possibilities of abuse of this provision in our [**public brief**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/104V9yn1ygjHjIdK92ZWz7P-oNvbjSrzY/view) on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 on the National Population Register (NPR). NPR was originally intended as a solution to the problem of infiltration at the national borders, and therefore nothing prevents the Central Government from invoking the grounds of security of the State to exempt NPR from the provisions of the Bill.

Clause 36 is another exemption available to the State. Law enforcement agencies are exempted from the provisions of the Bill except the obligation to process the data fairly and reasonably and to maintain security safeguards in processing the data, for law enforcement purposes such as prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of any offence or any other contravention of any law. Here again, the Bill has failed to mandate that the exemption should be granted only when it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes of law enforcement.

### Clause 35 vis-a-vis the Sri Krishna Committee Report

Clause 35 does not incorporate the recommendations of the Report of the Committee of Experts under the Chairmanship of Justice B.N. Srikrishna (‘[**A Free and Fair Digital Economy Protecting Privacy, Empowering Indians**](https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf)’), and is also a stark deviation from the 2018 draft of the Bill. The report warns that ‘the pillars of a data protection law should not be shaken by a vague and nebulous national security exemption’. However, it is unfortunate to note that the Bill does exactly what was feared by the Committee.

The report makes several incredible recommendations regarding surveillance provisions for a future data protection law:

The report discusses only one ground for exemptions; security of the State, as opposed to the five grounds given under clause 35. The report is emphatic that the exemptions to State should strictly adhere to the judgement of the Supreme Court of India in Justice K S Puttaswamy v. Union of India and Anr.

Any exemption from the data protection law must be ‘necessary and proportionate’ in the interest of the security of the State and such exemption should be pursuant to a law that meets the constitutionality test. Since exemptions involve infringement of privacy of the individuals, the report mandates that the restrictions on privacy should be proportionate and narrowly tailored to the stated objectives.

The report does not envisage a blanket exemption to the State. The agencies of the State are not exempted from the obligation to maintain security safeguards in processing personal data.

The report also addresses the issue of lack of oversight of intelligence gathering and recommends that the Central Government should bring in a law to this effect. The report states that there should be ex ante access control as well as ex post accountability. Therefore, the law should provide for both parliamentary oversight as well as judicial approval of all requests for non-consensual access to personal data. Further, the surveillance laws should provide for measures to assess the extent of risks of a proposed measure to the privacy of the individual.

### Solution : a New Chapter on Surveillance Reforms

As the [**fifth principle**](https://saveourprivacy.in/principles) of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 notes a complete code on data protection comes with strong surveillance reforms. Any data protection framework has to restrict mass or dragnet surveillance as it contravenes the principles of necessity, proportionality and purpose limitation. Procedural safeguards have to be in place even for individual surveillance and interception. Interception of communications has to be through an order passed by the judiciary. The principle also states that the evidence gathered illegally must be made inadmissible as evidence in legal proceedings.

It is imperative that the exemptions to the State under Bill be restricted and narrowly tailored to cater to the protection of the privacy of individuals. Surveillance and interception have serious implications on the privacy of individuals, yet it is inevitable in certain circumstances. Further, the current laws do not adequately address the privacy concerns caused by surveillance and interception of communications. Therefore, the Bill should devote a separate chapter for surveillance reforms. Moreover, the agencies of the State eligible/liable for being exempted under clause 35 must include only the agencies that are authorised by an Act of Parliament to to carry out surveillance and interception. Such agencies have to be clearly identified and notified by the Central government. Further, the Bill should also provide for [**procedures for such agencies to seek permission from a judicial authority**](https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf), preferably by special benches or tribunals consisting of retired High Court judges.

One of the main lacunae in the current surveillance laws is that there is no proper institutional oversight and accountability mechanism. Therefore, we recommend that an [**oversight and accountability structure**](https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf) be made part of the proposed architecture of the Data Protection Authority. An ideal way to do this would be to add within the Data Protection Authority an office for surveillance reform and oversight. For emergency surveillance and interception of communications [**permission may be granted through judicial orders**](https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf) and such orders must require the exempted agencies to follow the necessity and proportionality principles. Further, the enforcement and compliance mechanisms of such orders may be determined by the  Data Protection Authority.

Mass surveillance is an egregious form of surveillance and is unsuitable in any democratic society. Therefore, there needs to be an explicit ban on mass surveillance. Clause 35 in its current form can render the rights and protections of users under the Bill redundant, and hence the Bill needs to be reviewed to make it replete with safeguards against surveillance and plug the holes in the existing laws on surveillance in the country.

nklija,"Would love to hear your opinion.

According to my sanity however,

As someone who thinks we must adopt more western principles of Liberalism, I hate the restrictions of speech in India.  Everyone must have the right to speak whatever they can, Moderation must be done with critical thinking after you've spoken and not before you speak. And the moderation must be a general truth put forward and accepted by the people but not mandated by any body.  For instance I don't buy the mandation of use of pronouns in western countries.  And I'm against it, that does not mean that I'm going to call someone against their wish, that just means, 'You can tell me what to do, You can't force me what to do'.",What is your opinion on Free Speech in India?,AskIndia," What free speech? 

Right to life ka situation we see already with everyone dying around us 
slavery ka toh pm book mein likhte hai that those people are happy doing those jobs because they are born into that family

freedom of speech ka situation we know kal hi twitter office mein raid hua tha, 

Right to work and education, discrimination bhi karna hai but equal opportunity ni dena hai. 

Only thing is govt is incompetent and stupid asf. For anything they need the people on ground who are already against them. The concept of Free Speech in India is a sham.
Forget about Free Speech, even Free Thought isn't allowed.
Remember Munnawar Farooqui's detention for a joke 'he didnt crack' ?

Do you know Sudha Bharadwaj has been languishing in jail for 1000 days without any trial or shred of evidence produced against her in court? Imagine being in jail for nearly 3yrs without committing any offence.

Varavara Rao, Stan Swamy, Gautam Navlakha, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferriera and thousands such under trials have been detained without any credible evidence in absolute disregard not only for their consitutional rights but also those rights that accrue by virtue of being human.

There's is, however, a Free Speech of CONVENIENCE here. Any speech that may potentially cause discomfort, questions the regime, criticises, condemns, mocks or draws sarcasm is considered defiance. Such resistance may spur the dispensation to ruthlessly penalise the person.
Invoking stringent provisions like Sedition even for slightest of criticism is a way of intimidation unto submission. This is a characteristic response of fascist regimes.

The current regime, in particular, is averse to any kind of questions (evident from PM's discomfort to hold press conferences in the last 7yrs), criticism, condemnation.

It demands absolute and unconditional subservience from its people.

Unless we resist and fight psychological enslavement of ourselves and our peers, not just Free Speech but any form of Freedom appears either a distant dream or even a mirage!

India is a wrong place to be if what you seek are FREEDOM, LIBERTY AND FRATERNITY. Lauda mera... Ab free speech kuch nai hai. Khatam. the concept of freedom is you can do anything you want as long as you are not hurting others. but here people are way too invested in you that you just can not do what you want. for example elders being invested in their kid's like. people are ignorant and they don't wanna learn or accept. they take pride in not knowing things ffs. My observation on free speech in India

You're free to speak anything as long as you are not offending any person, society, community, religion, dead person, political party, God,and someone is not getting offended on behalf of someone else. LOL the literal first amendment to the constitution in 1951 put shackles on freedom of speech There is free speech in India? TIL What free speech?

Want to criticise any BJP alligned Govt?- Sedition,UAPA,NSA and ban it is.

If at all a new Govt comes, still there will be no police action against these people as they are able to control the political parties with their money power.

Good example is Gurmeet Ram Rahim. All the parties knew of his shady doings but offered him patronage and in turn received his money and people goodwill power.  Till he became a liability. Quite simple actually, it must be the huge donations he has given to the government anonymously through election bonds. Did you say money ? Freedom of speech only applies to baba.

nkkgx5,"I'm writing down my experiences and what I felt people should have told me, as a 6th sem student, and I regret wasting my time. Since I can't go back, and bring back what's lost, and I don't want you all to suffer like me, here's some FAQ-like guide.

**This is for CS  students only, but IS students can refer this as well.**

> - So there are some courses that I find interesting, I'll do it from second year

Please don't. Start with a course, as soon as you can. Also remember, more courses != (not equals)""yeah, I'll get a job"". Choose a specialization, and work only on that. If you have some interest in, let's say, ML and web, learn one of them as a hobby, but focus more on the one you want to do. Allot the first three months to find what interests you, and then, don't change your roadmap.

> - I am really confused about what to learn, should I go for web-dev or competitive programming, or android development?

Learning to code competitively is a good practice, but be reminded by the fact that you can't use the same technique for real-life development. You need to work with other dev as well, and if the code is not readable, don't be surprised if you're been cursed by some sort of black magic. What I am saying is, learn to code competitively, but stop getting obsessed with techniques to write smaller and faster code.

The first and foremost thing - in the first three years, try and explore all the fields briefly. Once you feel like, ""yeah, machine learning is my thing"", **START WITH THE FUCKING ROADMAP**. 

> - So there is this internship that I have to pay for, so should I...?

Stop, and get some help. Internship should not be ""pay and work"", It can either be ""free"" or ""get-paid"". Stop enabling these people to exploit you for labour as well as money. I will also guarantee you that you won't even get an iota of experience. My friend has taken part in such shitty scam, and he didn't like anything about it (subject was machine learning, the ""scammer"" made smart students to teach others, while he had a good night's sleep. He (my friend) was really irritated when others kept calling him for silly doubt which should have been taught by the ""scammer"").

If you want experience, work in **open source**. Open source is also a good way to meet new people and increase your connections.

If you want an internship for namesake (let me guess, you're studying under VTU?), just get some random digital marketing internship, or volunteer intership on Internshala. If you want to try your luck with startups, Angel.co and YCombinator should work.

> - But open source is really hard...

I agree partially, to be honest. And the reason is that i) if a community is small, or ii) if the maintainers of the project don't interact with you, you  start feeling frustrated.
Choose an easier project to work on. Let's be realistic, most of you probably don't even know anything about coding. Just because you've read a book does not make you any expert. Start with labels like ""good first issue"", ""easy"", ""beginner"", or ""hacktober"". Also remember, contribution is not necessarily coding. You may also contribute by improving the documentation, or helping other new users with their issues.

> - Okay, so I'll start learning all courses...

Hol the fuck up. Don't EVER DO this. Learn only courses that matter to you. If I am not wrong, some people also promote Microsoft certified, Google certification and all such crap. Don't waste your money on that. They're crap. I've wasted my money on Microsoft's CPMA course, and it is garbage.

> - So yeah, I've done all that stuff. What now?

Take part in extracurricular activities like hackathon, externships and  fellowships. GSOC, MLH fellowship, Outreachy, Tweag, are some examples. They're all a great way to get real like experience, and also to earn some bucks (I think for 3 months, you're getting paid like 1.5 lacs for Google, and 3 lacs for Tweag)

> - You've said this and that wrong...

If I've said so, I would agree with you. No one has ever said this to me, and since I am a first generation degree holder (meaning, I'll be the first one in my family to get a degree), I did not have many people to recommend and guide me. So basically, I am at a disadvantage, compared to my other peers. If you're just like me, this ""misinformation"" should suffice, and still help you.

> - Some good website to practice coding? Other ""generic"" tips?

I don't like HackerRank, HackerEarth and Codechef, to be honest. I used to practice on Codewars, but then, I felt like the difficulty system was messed up, so I switched to Exercism.  Geek for geeks is also good. You should subscribe to Kunal's youtube channel (Code for Cause), and Ishan Sharma. Since they're in the same year as I am, I can kind of relate with them. Also, master one language properly. If it's C++, master it. But don't forget to learn scripting languages like Python or Ruby. I would not recommend you to learn newer languages like Julia or Crystal, but as a hobby, sure, why not? Just remember to check their pros and cons. **Don't take interview and aptitude lightly**. I have, and it has costed me a lot.


Also, **very IMPORTANT**: LEARN GIT, please.

2. Arrest people who had erected anti-CAA/NRC boards earlier.

3. Enact a Goonda Act when Lakshadweep has the lowest crime rate in the country. The people believe this is to target those protesting against union government policies.

4. Remove non-vegetarian items from the school food menu.

5. Promulgate a regulation criminalizing slaughter of cattle and transportation and trade of beef products. Even slaughter of other animals will require prior permission.

6. Introduce a draft law to disqualify panchayat members with more than 2 kids.

7. Dismiss hundreds of contract and casual workers employed by government offices. Terminate mid-day meal workers, physical education teachers etc.

8. Close down 38 Anganwadis.

9. Stop freight transit through Beypore port in Kerala to cut traditional ties with the state.

10. Citing the Coast Guard Act and demolishing the temporary sheds built by fishermen to store their nets and equipments, with permission from the previous administration. This in a place where fishing is the main source of income.

11. Lift restrictions on sale of alcohol.

12. Propose the widening of roads in a manner in which many homes and buildings will have to be demolished. This in a place where traffic is low because the number of vehicles are less.

13. Promote large scale private tourism ventures.

14. All diary farms in Lakshadweep have been ordered closed and Gujarat-based Amul milk products are being forced onto the people. They have called for a boycott. Critical social media posts are being censored and internet blackout looms large.

These decisions have been taken against the wishes of the people primarily to curb the democratic rights of the ~64,000 people who live in the territory, 97% of whom are muslims.

Ensure it is not polluting local water supplies. The norm is to have a underground pit to which the sludge goes.  This is what all farmhouse use.

Build a septic tank for your toilet and a pit to drain liquid waste from kitchen/bathroom.

Do confirm if you have septic tank cleaning service in your area because they need to be emptied in 7-10years. Why do you want to stay in a Village?

Some interesting bits from the paper, based on my reading of the document:

1. There were 100 people involved, 50 were given Coronil and 50 were given placebo, and seems like for 5 people who took Coronil they disqualified the result (See the n value in the image where they describe initial health numbers).
2. All the people had 97+ oxygen saturation throughout.
3. Mean clinical characteristics for everyone seems to be in healthy range.
4. Almost everyone in the trial was aged less than 55. 3 people in the placebo group were more than age 55, while 1 person in the Coronil group was aged more than 55.
5. They claim that 100% of people recovered by the 7th day for the Coronil group, while only 70% of people recovered in the placebo group. With a sample set of 50, this means 15 people in the placebo group were still testing positive by the 7th day. It is not specified for how much time did persons in the placebo or in the Coronil group were already testing positive for.

nkk071,,Dalit man attacked for sporting moustache,Culture & Heritage ," What in the actual fuck? This is so awful. What is wrong with these barbaric people? I hope the guy gets well soon. Poor thing! If that's him in the picture, he's absolutely rocking that mustache <3 Just by headlines I knew it must be Gujarat. Indians true enemies are Indians itself. India is rich in resources, nature and weather. But we have turned to a society where we treat our own people unequally. You know what, there's only one solution I see to casteism. (It's not education.)

The government must force all religious babas and priests to declare that being casteist is anti-Hindu. If they don't, then throw them in jail. It's definitely not the truth, because caste is a BIG part of Hinduism, but I'm sure it'll do the trick. Most Indians blindly follow these babas and other religious figures. If it's somehow drilled in their heads that caste is anti-Hindu, I'm sure it'll work for at least 50-60% of people.

It's not as if things like these haven't been done before. If I'm not wrong, in Eastern Europe, churches were taken over by commies and used to promote Marxism, because they felt that the common people would be far more likely to be influenced by priests than other communists.

Edit - Apparently, there's some religious correctness to the above as well. The concept of Hindu social laws is called *dharmashastra*, which is considered to be modifiable and reformable, to suit the time (*kal*) and place (*sthan*) of a particular era. Some texts, like the Matsya Purana, openly state that they are to be modified to remain useful to society. 

The government can have these babas make up shit like they're 'updating the dharma' and blah blah. I tell you, religious people will *lap* it up like milk. We're a nation that killed a beggar for stealing food.

But we're also a nation, that kept quiet when Niravs and Mallya's steal billions of money from banks I thought this was either haryana or UP but here I am reading about the Gujarat model! But, but.. reservations should be merit based.. casteism doesn't exist.. I don't even know my own caste. Same state, about three years ago:

A Modi supporter back in 2019 had told me that we Hindus don't have any holy site. I just laughed at him and replied a few of the already holy pilgrimages like Amarnath, Hrishikesh, Vaishno Devi that people carry out in huge numbers. And besides investing in the construction of temples shouldn't be a job for the government, but who'll argue with that bhakt logic. You forgot Tirupati? Go to Facebook for shit posting. Well yes I feel so No. Because it is going to be a corporate gimmick like Isha, iskon etc.

Ancient temples are the originals... They are not sophisticated but people believe those gods have ""power"" What's western wall? You mean the wailing wall? 4 Dhams: Am I a joke to you. The Ayodhya one might become one for the Hindi speaking belt depending on marketing, but it won't be so for the rest of the nation. I don't see why someone who worships say Shiva or Kali would visit a Ram temple.

For that why would Buddhists or Jains conduct pilgrimages to Hindu holy sites? I don't think so. Maybe be for the North but definitely not for all of India. Unlike other holy temples, Ayodhya might have a stigma because of its political connotations. Considering the negative impact the demolition of the babri masjid had on our country's secular fabric, I don't see how the temple of Ayodhya will be considered the epicenter of Hinduism considering we have so many Holy temples already. I'm a devout Ram devotee, but I will NEVER step into that temple which is being made by spilling the blood of innocent ppl. That temple is a monument to bigotry, hatred, violence, lawlessness. If there is a temple anywhere in the world which is an ode to Adharma, it is this. It has nothing to do with Ram, with devotion, with prayer, with love, with compassion, with justice.


Just like one doesn't become a doctor simply by putting on a white lab coat, and just like one doesn't become a sanyaasi by merely wearing ochre clothes, similarly a place doesn't become a temple simply by constructing it in the shape of a temple. Any Hindu who visits this blood stained Ram Mandir is inheriting paap.

There are many less paapi and longstanding pilgrimage sites IMHO. This was something I was pondering over when the whole Ram Mandir judgement came out. That had there been a Mandir there would have been a tradition of pilgrimage to that temple just as there is to Mathura, Tirupati etc. 

There is no mention any place of such a tradition for Ayodhya. That I felt was a question the judges should have taken into account."

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/social-media-giants-yet-to-comply-with-government-rules-as-deadline-ends-tomorrow-1806506-2021-05-24

We must stop thinking about this govt as passive citizens and start considering active survival mechanisms against it.

**Need of the hour**

Free methods to access blocked services from India, communicate safely, and post online privately without ISP snooping. We need platforms where we can speak freely and without police consequence. The amount of self-censorship Indians are already doing would have made the founding fathers weep.

Signal use must be adopted. That secures your chats (though physical possession of your phone would make it pointless). But we need more solutions, for everything from email to payments. WE need a cypher punk approach - cowtowing to government is simply a losing game at this point.


For social media, it is important Indians never stop posting on global social media platforms, or the world will not know what is happening. How can we access them despite a ban?

VPNs are often touted as solution but let's consider the majority of people who cannot afford them. Are there decentralised solutions to web-access? Is Tor truly safe (or does its use paint your connection as an outlier worth monitoring, at an ISP level)?

In general, we have to start acting like Chinese citizens who subscribe to VPNs like it's a normal thing.

When in doubt, ask what the freedom fighters would do if they lived in India today.",WE must prepare for the possibility of major social media platforms being banned.,Science/Technology," So India is becoming worst version of china? Because of these stupid brainless andhbhakts. Not going to happen. One of BJP's core strengths is its vast army of online trolls (or the IT cell) and the perception management or spin doctoring it does. If social media goes, BJP's core strength will be compromised. Why do you think these tech giants do not give a fuck? They know BJP needs them as much they need Indian market. IT cell will become unemployed So was it this when people were telling India will surpass China? Lol, they won’t ban social media (they can’t due to lack of technical personnel in upper echelons). 

At Max, then might ask corpos to introduce Aadhar or OTP based login system as compulsory in India for “The cattle” (fellow citizens) to follow. What about discord will it be banned too India’s constitution is the largest in the world, isnt freedom of speech on there, so how can they ban outlets of speech and news? Unlikely to happen. India is now almost an ally to US with quad cooperation. India is not in situation to challenge American corporate hegemony. One simple understanding from a this they have majority they can do the hell they want no one can oppose, if they do then do it who cares. This is their attitude and by banning these platforms ia nothing just they don't want those questions to come out in front of their so called bhakt and their legacy will keep going on like that. Media houses we know how they do their job so only place where people can ask, can get actual information but they want to control this as well. Conclusion everything is under the control and hence they will become God. According section 79 it act these platforms are free from any legal problems if any of the user post their. But if they don't follow the government new rules then that will be withdrawn and they might face lega issues if any user post any thing that can hurt their sentiments ( which will be decided by them only, when to get hurt or when not to). ""Ministry of Truth"" bracing up to bring Utopia! We have reached here in 7 years. This is not where we wanted to be. Our rights eroded, our people dead, and the population broke.

nki24p,"I heard of the passing of Krishna* yesterday - yet another unsung victim of COVID-19 that has claimed thousands of lives across the country, and millions globally. 

Krishna was a friendly neighbor who would make small talk with me and share local news and happenings in the neighborhood. 
Although it was shocking, like every death, it wasn’t unexpected given that Krishna had been hospitalized and was on a ventilator for a week, gradually going downhill. A couple of weeks ago I realized he was ailing when he came to collect coconuts we had gathered from our tree - his dry whooping cough was a dead giveaway though he was mobile and tried sounding ‘normal’. This was a few days before he officially tested “positive” and had to be hospitalized. 

In his mid-sixties, Krishna and his wife were living a typical middle-class dream – kids and family living nearby, grandkids going to a decent private school. The pandemic cut short his life rather hastily. 

Krishna and his wife lived off the rent from a multi-story house built on a small plot a couple of rows opposite our house. He lived in the ground floor with his wife and a son and had let out the 5-6 rooms on the two floors above to students from a nearby university. He had gifted a part of his plot to his daughters who had built another multi-story house where they lived with their families. 

He also owned a private-auto that he would drive around. In the mornings he would run errands - buying greengroceries and supplies for other Paying Guests (PGs) in the neighborhood, after which he had the entire day to himself. 

On most days, Krishna could be seen walking around the neighborhood, chatting with all and sundry. Even during the days leading to the recent lockdown, one could spot him chatting with the local vendors and hawkers on the main road nearby. During late afternoons, I would see him lounging on his auto parked near our compound where he would hold impromptu meetings and get-togethers with his friends. 

Given the severity of pandemic and spread of COVID-19, one wonders if he should have been a bit more cautious, not ‘socializing’ as much. But it is not for us to question what, or why. 

There was a flurry of activity in the neighborhood yesterday, and a few locals were seen walking around gathering near Krishna’s house. I suspected something afoot; perhaps he was being shifted to an ICU for Oxygen? Turns out, he had just passed away. 

With the COVID-protocols in place, his body was directly whisked away from the hospital to the crematorium for a quick and quiet funeral. Unlike ‘normal,’ times no neighbors or friends around to pay their last respects to the departed. 

With his abrupt passing, Krishna joins the thousands of unsung names and faces who are ending up as yet another blip in the great-statistical count of our generation.

\[...\]

The Opposition has latched on the image of floating bodies in the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh, which has been an integral theme of BJP's politics in the state where Modi, a Lok Sabha MP from holy Hindu city Varanasi had famously said that he was called by mother Ganga (*Mujhe to Ma Ganga ne Bulaya Hai*). The human tragedy of Covid-19 coupled with a crumbled health infrastructure in the state has the potential to dent not only Brand Yogi (of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath) but also Brand Modi and that is a real concern as off late, the party has been contesting elections only in the name of Modi.

Realising the political damage it may cause, the party has been gearing up to counter the perception. Nadda has held meetings with over two dozen states in the last week, asking party leaders to work on the ground for people bracing the pandemic and be seen on the ground.

The party may also go in for a much-delayed Cabinet reshuffle now and give a facelift to the government. It has changed two sitting Chief Ministers -- Trivendra Singh Rawat and Sarbananda Sonowal, quietly in Uttarakhand and Assam in less than three months. Both of them could be inducted into the Cabinet, besides Congress-turned-BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, who delivered Madhya Pradesh to the BJP after the party had lost the state in 2018. Some heads may roll to give an impression that the government is in action but the party's all-powerful Parliamentary Board is yet to be constituted.

Although there is still nine months for Uttar Pradesh to go for the next Assembly polls, the BJP, apparently alarmed by the possibility of an adverse fallout of alleged Covid-19 'mismanagement' and a dismal performance in the recently-concluded panchayat polls in the state, has started preparations for the elections though in a discreet manner.

It was discretion that forced the BJP to re-christen its slogan of '*har booth par jeet*' (victory on every booth) as '*har booth par vaccination*' (vaccination on every booth).

""Our workers will be cooperating with the vaccination teams and ensure that the people from every booth, especially in the rural areas, are given the shots,"" Naveen Srivastava, the media co-convener of the state BJP, said here on Monday.

Speaking to *DH*, Srivastava rejected assertions that the alleged Covid-19 'mismanagement' could have an ''adverse impact'' on the saffron party's electoral fortunes in Uttar Pradesh.

Sources in the BJP here, however, said that the saffron party was ""worried"" about the possible fallout of the alleged failure of the government to provide adequate medical care to Covid-19 patients in the towns and save a large number of people in rural areas.

The worries also stemmed from the party's dismal performance in the recently held panchayat polls. BJP-backed nominees could win 750 of the 3,050 Zila Panchayat seats. Its arch-rival Samajwadi Party bagged 760 seats. BJP-supported candidates lost even in the saffron bastions of Kashi, Mathura, Ayodhya, Lucknow, Kanpur, Agra and many other places.

Another worry for the party is the ongoing tussle within the party, which was evident from the outbursts of its own party leaders after four BJP legislators died from Covid 19 in the past few days.

BJP MPs Kaushal Kishore and Rajendra Agarwal and Uttar Pradesh minister Brijesh Pathak criticised the state government for failing to ensure an uninterrupted supply of oxygen and Remdesivir to the Covid-19 patients.

The BJP, smarting from criticism that its leaders were seen to be MIA at the height of the second surge, has urged its workers to dedicate themselves to serve and visibly so.

In a letter to all BJP-ruled states on the weekend, Mr Nadda said all functions to mark seven years of the Narendra Modi government must be avoided on May 30. ""Party workers should dedicate themselves in the service of the society,"" he wrote, and said people must be thanked for giving the BJP a chance to serve for seven years.

**Long term planning:**

In the second wave of Coronavirus, the limitations of health infrastructure have been made clear. In the coming year, there will be speedy remedies employed in this sector.

Center and the party will put forth a plan for long term facilities improvement.

Sangh loyalists have informed that this is to improve the image of the central government.

**Aggressive response to the opposition:**

Battle plans have been drawn to counter the strong verbal attacks launched by the opposition. The criticism of handling of Kumbh Mela will be neutralized using the example of Farmers Protests. The criticism of Modi's election rallies in West Bengal will be responded with how leaders of other parties also held rallies in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Assam.

Already too late now. He's just making money because he knows people will buy his stuff. Go to any local patanjali during the pandemic and you'd see jugs of gaumtra being sold out. So who's a bigger culprit? Him or the public? My braincells died If you are a Baba why haven't you achieved moksha yet? Seems like you need to do some meditation. He needs to be slapped in public lol There is literally a conspiracy theory circulating on the whatsapp which says these pharma companies and doctors are trying to loot Indians. Ramdev Baba came up with the solution months ago but this pharma lobby opposed him and brought down his product. BJP cannot disassociate themselves from Ramdev. It is a symbiotic relationship. Government helps him with cheap lands and everything else and he brings in votes. It maybe bad for dealing for pandemic but that is not a concern for government anyway.

Its the money. 

Both, north Indian business & political decision makers & south Indian business & political decision makers do have a range of emotions, from anger to breaking-down to unable to eat to, unable to sleep, when they see the damage, destruction & deaths left by the pandemic. They also conduct many urgent meetings, during the day & during the night, by working more than 18-hours a day. There are also many web-meetings, zoom conferences among the support teams.

Business associations provide a helping hand too, with few webinars. All hectic activity around. They all come to decisions of quick action &removing all obstacles of red-tape, bureaucratic delays. They also lament how it has been times of sheer inefficiency, poor leadership, lack of focus, during last year, last 2 years, last decade & last few decades stretching to at least 70 years. And more decisions are made so as to make sure that it won’t be like yesteryears any more as it is a new generation, people are with new aspirations & new focus.

And then the question of money or making payments come:

Before conducting exams during this time, remember that we would be voting in the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. Online exams? I'm sure there are many ways to ensure that students don't cheat.... Yes agreed. Nobody is more foolish. *Sigh* BJP Ministers: hold my gomutra. IMO, Govt.

Not everyone have high speed internet.
Most of us cant bear the expense of treatment which sums up lakhs of rupees.
But everyone have got a mobile phone.
The recorded calls then needs to be checked like copies are checked after exams awarding teachers rupees per record. Students dont vote so their vote bank won't be affected. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️🤦 Ab to hoke rahegi exam bencho this whole party is of snakes... just a little love byte before the kill i guess."

After 'withdrawing' his controversial comment against allopathy, by writing a letter to the Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, Baba Ramdev 'with humility' on Monday, posed before the All India Medical Association some questions that entail a swift reversal.. Taking to his official Twitter handle, the Patanjali co-founder and Yoga guru posed as many as 25 questions related to some of the most common diseases and asked for their solution and treatment in the allopathy and pharma industry.

Baba Ramdev poses 25 questions before IMA

Baba Ramdev posed before the IMA the following questions:-

What permanent solution does allopathy offer for treating Hypertension and its complications'

What permanent solution does Allopathy offer for treating Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes, and its complications'

What permanent solution does allopathy offer for treating Thyroid, Arthritis, Colitis, and Asthma'

Just like allopathy offers treatment for TB and Chicken Pox, does it has any medicine for treating Fatty Liver, Liver Cirrhosis, Hepatitis' Find a solution to such diseases as allopathy is a field, which is over 200 years old.

What treatment does the pharma industry offer to research heart blockages' Does it also offer a non-surgical solution to Angioplasty'

Does the pharma Industry offer treatment for Enlarged Heart and Ejection Fraction (ET) without using a pacemaker'

Does Allopathy offer treatment for reducing cholesterol triglycerides, which does not cause any side-effect on the liver'

Does the pharma Industry have a permanent solution to cure Headache and Migraine'

Does the pharma Industry have any permanent treatment so that glasses and hearing aid can be removed'

Give a curable treatment for Pyria in Allopathy, which can stop the weakening of gums and teeth.

Is there is medicine, which can help a person reduce 0.5-1 kg every day without any surgical treatment'

Mankind is walking towards the path of hatred and violence. Is there any Allopathic treatment for the same'

Is there any Allopathic medicine, which can help a person to give up all drug-related addictions'

Does the pharma industry has a medicine, which can put an end to a fight between Allopathy and Ayurveda'

Does the pharma industry have a solution to treat COVID-19 patients, without using liquid medical oxygen'

If Allopathy is capable of treating every disease and health condition, then its doctor should never fall ill.",Is he trolling the medical fraternity or asking serious doubts?,AskIndia," these are nonsense questions its like asking isro ""can you send humans to sun if not they you're useless"". IMA shouldn't answer such questions. What proof do we have that absolutely anything in Ayurveda works? IMA should ignore this fool. Not worth giving him the attention. This is stupidity, any doctor saying just taking medicines will fix everything is as bigger quack as Ramdev

His question list has shown he has no idea about allopathy or medicine at all. Please stop posting this garbage and stop inflicting pain to yourself. A doctor who has got time to reply to all these now is probably not a good doctor. Not a good use of time when patients are waiting for help."

China is dominating global trading for being the biggest trading partner for most countries on the earth (they overtook USA in roughly 2013).

And in [this post about RCEP](https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/drgxu9/sources_india_decides_not_to_join_regional/), a lot of Indians support Modi's decision of not signing RCEP, saying that China is lying/cheating/tricking other countries into trade deals in favor of solely China's interests thus not joining RECP is a victory for India. These kinds of arguments sound bizarre to me, which is equivalent to saying that ministers from those countries who choose to trade with China are dumber than a common Indian redditor that they are falling into China's trap and eventually would destroy their own countries. I just couldn't believe they are this dumb to be in their positions.

So my question is, for people who believe China is plotting in global trading, how exactly has it done to achieve? And why are most countries simply buying it?",How does China manipulate global trading?,Policy/Economy,

#You all have betrayed India, You all have sold your souls just to make money, You all have fooled Indians all across the Globe, You all are minting money over deaths of Lakhs of Indians who died and are in line to die because of your sheer negligence, mismanagement, misrepresentation, and you all are continuing to do so. Your resignation will be first step towards healing India and its people. If you really love this country which you called as your own, please please please RESIGN at the earliest.

Though this is not the only issue for which you are responsible as there are plenty of them, but this is HUMONGOUS GENOCIDE.

Edit: Thank you for giving awards to the post. But it’s a request, please don’t just give awards, ensure you educate at least 2 people in your circle about these people and ask them not to vote for these politicians and not to watch news channels which spread hatred and promote Thugs like Ramdev for money making.

#Many of you are asking, Why Nitin Gadkari?

He is the same man (equally responsible) who relaunched Coronil of Thug Ramdev along with Harsh Vardhan (Health Minister of India) with a banner educating this Thug Ramdev’s followers about WHO certification for Coronil (which was falsely stated). Just see the irony of India, the Indian media and public were told about a so called WHO certification for Coronil in presence of India’s Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who also happens to be the Chairman of Executive Board of the World Health Organization (WHO). Their sins cannot be washed away even if they did some good work in the past/present. Also changing the formula to measure road development doesn’t equate to better work than predecessors. His name has also been involved in multiple corruption related reports where no independent enquiry was set up to investigate him. However, I am asking for his resignation purely for Covid-19 related GENOCIDE in India.

#Some also asked, Why Pranoy Roy?

Because many times NDTV plays from both sides. I agree with the views that NDTV is ripping apart this Government on its handling of Covid-19, and has been doing so for many other issues as well. However, NDTV even though criticises Ramdev and his actions, but also let him use its platform to advertise Patanjali and Ramdev himself. I understand the money involved in running a channel, but that doesn’t mean to survive you start promoting a drug dealer, or a serial killer. Therefore, Prannoy Roy is equally responsible for promoting this con man to build his brand Patanjali, which is fooling India in the name of Swadesi/Swadeshi, Ayurveda, and what not.

Edit 2: Added Nirmala Sitaraman and Ramesh Pokhriyal’s names as well — Thanks to all those who reminded me about them.

nkiz9b,"I know people love to live in their esconsed world view of self serving biases, but at a certain point one needs to realise that this whole media thing is a bloody charade. 

Media's only goal, only raison d'être, if one is honest enough to notice, is propaganda, and it's even truer for the west. If not for anything else, then because more people believe in it, especially in India. We all know indian media is useless, but people easily forget that a significant portion of the news in the west is also categorically decietful, especially regarding the non western world, where they're always more than willing to effect a regime change, and not only for the democracy.  

I'm emphasising on the west because many people here have rose-tinted glasses when it comes to the west, and it's precisely because of the western Propaganda. Western news is also a pack of lies, same as India [gulf of tonkin, Nayirah testimony(first gulf war), weapons of mass destruction, anything regarding the left in latin America, anything regarding Africa, Iran, Russia, China, N.Korea, (btw has anyone kept the count of how many times they've killed Kim Jong un and his family?) and to a lesser extent India is always portrayed in the negative light.

I'm not writing much about indian media 
because it's pathetic (aadhi Haqeeqat aadha fasaana), aside from the possible exception of Ravish Kumar(even of that I'm not sure). Indian news media companies are so pathetic that they don't even pretend to act for the truth or the good; but west does that very well, hence there're so many believers of west in India.


I know one can make mistakes and also amends. But the real rotten thing is: there is no accountability for any of the fake news and consensus building, so far so that today there is nothing but fake news. Such as Trump being a Russian implant story that carried on for four years and before that there was the Benghazi attack conspiracy theory for four years and on and on...

I mean, what is one supposed to do?

Shouldn't there be some restrictions on faux news, but then restrictions would lead to the violation of the freedom of press. But is there really any freedom of press when press is either owned by the state or by the rich? Can there really be the freedom of press?

> After observing several such patients, they are of the view that the insertion of a swab (a cotton ball) in the nose during the RT-PCR test could be one of the main reasons for the outbreak of this fungal disease.

> They say that on questioning, these patients said that they underwent RT-PCR tests multiple times to find out if they are Covid positive or not. This has made the doctors believe that it could be due to swabs. In western countries like the UK and the USA, these swabs are sterilised before use, through gamma radiation, however, in India, there is no quality control on their production and handling.

>“Almost all the cases prevalent in India are of Rhino-orbito-cerebral Mucormycosis which means the infection starts from the nose and proceeds towards the eyes and brain,” said the doctor quoted above. In rare cases, black fungal infections are found in the lungs and digestive tract. “Had infected oxygen been the reason, then the cases of Pulmonary Mucormycosis would have also been in reasonable numbers,"" he added.

>This study supports the observation of government doctors that during the first wave, the number of RT-PCR tests was far less than during the second wave. They dismiss the hypothesis that oxygen could be one of the reasons. “Even the industrial oxygen supplied to hospital for medical purposes maintains the 99.5% purity. Besides, the high pressure and extremely low temperature (below -183 degree) at which it is stored and transported it is impossible for the fungus to remain present there,” the doctor said.

Now this is a scary situation. There were also news reports that MH police busted an organisation which asked slum-dwellers to prepare swabs without the proper hygienic equipment. What the hell is this now.. Quite possible that the fact inferred is true. Just a few days ago, I read the news that swabs are made by the people who lives in dharavi hut without any hygiene. nothing works properly This makes so much sense. What we need to do right now is really investigate and collect the data of the people that are infected with this, ask them or their family members if they used oxygen concentrators or cylinders, past medical history, their mask wearing habits, the environment at home (if it's too humid or something), how they were tested for the virus, and so on, and immediately make this information public so we can start to figure out exactly why it's infecting more people than it should. Far more likely bacteria ridden face masks are the cause. Few people would change them frequently enough. Fewer still would understand the need to not touch them to avoid the use of masks becoming completely pointless."

I was looking at this list and had my mind blown, sure cities grow fast especially in India but Bangalore went from 4 million in 2001 to 8 million in 2011, it literally doubled it's population how can a City effectively double in population in a decade and still function properly. How did this happen and how did the city manage to find housing for effectively another city of people showing up in the span of a decade?","Bangaloreans and Indians who visited Bangalore, how has the city changed in the last 2 decade?",AskIndia," >how can a City effectively double in population in a decade and still function properly.

It can't.. Prime example is Bangalore.

Roads are shit, water problem everywhere, too many power cuts, rent is expensive, veggies are expensive, traffic is horrifying.

But hey, compared to other cities, insane opportunities to work and earn money and enjoy the food and drinks and culture.

It's not like we have too many other options right. It simply cannot. I live here and struggle with the change everyday. Not only has the city become polluted and dirty but we are also seeing the impact of climate change. Sure, we can get anything at click of a button but that has come at a terrible cost. Spoiler Alert!! Not everyone found housing Work from home if you can in the future When I went there around 2000,it was such a clean, chill city. Now it's an expensive traffic clogged city It's name also got changed to Bengaluru. My dad, a govt. of India officer on transfer from his home state, worked briefly in Bangalore in early 70s. He reckons it wasn't even a city compared to Mumbai, Delhi or Kolkata at that time. At best it was a large town, cool climate and beautiful with gardens. So it must have changed much more than most Indian cities. You mean Bangaloreans are not Indians? Cooling charges. It hasnt coped well. Infrastructure is megafucked- I try not to go anywhere beyond a 2km radius from my house unless it's late night or I'm cabbing/metro

In terms of the effect the population has had, bangalore has always been very cosmopolitan- people from north south everywhere. Earlier afaik there was very little discord between any community. Now there's huge population coming here for jobs, many north indians refuse to learn basic kannada and claim hindi in the national language and shit; so there's an amount of resentment towards them from the locals. I think that wasn't there so much earlier

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/india) if you have any questions or concerns.* Who knows tbh? 

Manmohan Singh (assuming he was the PM) would have at least planned for the economic fallout and recovery from the pandemic and lockdowns. 

For most part, the focus on healthcare at district level has been poor in India. It’s only when the middle class could not find beds in the private hospitals they started to turn to the woeful government hospitals and the reality hit them hard. I hope this is the turning point when the government starts taking healthcare seriously and not as an unnecessary indulgence. Modi's biggest mistake, shared by the bulk of his supporters, was in believing that India is an almost-superpower. That's where the decision to not allow imported vaccines, and the decision to indulge in vaccine diplomacy stems from. Modi also saw in covid-19 a grand opportunity to present himself as not only India's, but the World's saviour. The narrative would be: China screwed the world, we saved it. All that came crashing down, of course.

Under the Congress, we'd be under no such illusion. We'd stay in our ""_aukat_"" that we're a third world shithole: no vaccines exported, ramp up and max out our domestic manufacturing capacities, approve, pre-book and negotiate deals for Pfizer, Moderna and pretty much every vaccine under the sun that showed encouraging results in clinical trials. 

Along with an aggressive vaccination campaign,  decisions like not allowing economically unproductive activity (temples, festivals, elections, Kumbh) until a major chunk of the population was vaccinated might have caused a milder second wave and maybe even prevented the B1617 variant from evolving.

Hypothetically speaking. Instead of muffling the voice of experts, Congress would've always allowed experts to speak upfront! Look at Maharashtra, It has formed a team of experts and they are only taking decisions!

Second thing, Giving money to Poor people so they don't die hungry.

Third, Not hiding numbers! This is must, as numbers tell you actual ground condition and necessary steps needed to take...

Making space for better people in top cadre instead of allowing failed ones to continue...Nobody in Modi Government resign! 

Good relations with foreign countries so they help more proactively.

Lastly, Would have let everyone work freely to their capacity to help anyone in need!

I know, Congress would've failed miserably too, given its India, but still they would've fought much better way than tone deaf and incompetent Modi! Modi's MO is shock and awe. DeMo - give almost no prep time to people. GST - rushed thru in parliament and in implementation. Lockdown: Almost no warning.

On the other hand UPA did everything with a deliberate pace, with consensus. We wouldnt have these surprise fuck ups every alternate year with them. 

The other big mistake I see, is not ordering enough vaccine and not doing so early enough. Modi declared victory too soon and began giving away vaccines to other countries - a promise that he has since turned back on. UPA on the other hand, was always happy to spend more money. We would have had enough and more vaccine from the get go. Manmohan singh would have at least listened to the experts and would have prepared for the economic fallout. The reason we are even in this position is because of the anti-science self-congratulations that are a hallmark of this specific government. Congress had been in power for years and never gone down this route. It takes messaging and clarity (leadership) from the top to handle situations like these. If instead everyone drinks the kool-aid, everyone just thinks we are impervious to this virus, everyone thinks banging pots and pans and our spiritual superiority has rid us of it, then the preparations will be as they were - zero. This, when the most powerful country in the world struggled with this same exact situation just 6 months ago. Congress would not have blinded us all with this delusion. We would have been more prepared just by virtue of this fact."

What were the consequences of it when you left home in teenage or adulthood?",Culture & Heritage ," Major reason is gender biased in house chores. Most of the parents won't teach their male child about cooking, cleaning or washing cloths. I'm lucky that my parents encouraged me. They taught me how to cook, how to do household chores. On other hand my cousin seem to struggle living alone for straight two days. He can't make Maggi. He's stuck in Siliguri right now. All he can do is order and eat junk food. 
What's the point of being a jobless engineer from a private college when you can't even cook. His parents keep bragging that how his son has the most coveted degree in this world. 
Idk what's wrong with most important parents. They're now upset because my food business is doing excellent and I'm preparing for Civil Services Examination. They even keep saying that commerce students have no hope in such examination when their own son couldn't keep a job for 2 months and has been unemployed since last 3 and a half years.
Honestly teach your kids the basic necessities of live. Teach your son to take risks and be respectful to others. I think I'm a prime example of that. Till I was 17 I lived with my parents and as mentioned didn't have to do a single chore in the house. I only used to wash my undies and I use to wash my plate after food. That's it. 
But even then I craved for an independent life. So I chose a college far from home so I could stay in a hostel. Here the extra chore would be washing my clothes. I didn't have any problem with that.
Then 4 years of college and soon moved to another city for work. There too I stayed in hostels. Except for washing clothes there wasn't much. Food is provided, bills are taken care of, I just had to pay the monthly rent. 
But then when I turned 28 I got married 😄. 4 months back. 
Due to lockdown we're still at my in laws house. I don't have to do cooking. But I wash all the dishes. They don't hire servants here. On weekends both my husband and I clean the entire first floor. I occasionally clean the bathroom too. 
Of all these chores I think I don't t like washing dishes part most coz...hmm... I guess mostly ego. 
I have negative thoughts like I came here to wash dishes, but I know in reality I have it very easy.
 It wouldn't have been a problem if I was made to do it at my house.
Now the real test will come when we both have to go back to our work cities and start living in a flat.

So consequences...I adjusted pretty well.. except for the bitter feeling while washing dishes😅 Had to learn. Wasnt as bad as people made it out to be. 

Washing your clothes is easy. Sweeping and mopping is easy. Cooking food takes practice but is easy once you get the hang of it."

The Health Minister said coronil claims to be cured of corona patients. Therefore, the government is committed to the health and treatment of the people of Haryana. The government does not want to leave any shortage in the treatment of Corona patients, we are trying as much as possible.  
**Opposition parties not well wishers: Vij**  
On May 26, Health Minister Anil Vij has made sharp remarks on the opposition parties' support for the joint demonstration of the United Kisan Morcha at the national level. Vij said that opposition parties are not well wishers of farmers. If they were, they would have motivated them to get vaccinated and tested. They want to ask the opposition parties whether they ever asked the farmers for vaccination? Had it been said, the opposition parties would have been his well wishers. They are fatal to them.

nkgum1,,"Pfizer, Moderna order books full, India looks at long, uncertain wait",Politics," Hope all rich Indians pinning their hopes on Pfizer and Moderna being approved quickly in India wake up and smell the coffee. 

mRNA vaccine production is tricky so it’s not easy to clone the manufacturing process. Moderna has actually waived intellectual property rights to its vaccine, so **anyone** can make it. But no one has, so far.

And their order book is now billions of doses. India is way behind in the back of the line thanks to the Centre’s inability to place orders in time. 

The most realistic “quick win” at this point is for India to authorise use of these vaccines and allow commercial imports. This way the private sector can perform some small-scale vaccinations at least in larger metro cities.

Edit: LOL at the downvoters. Sure, take your frustration out by hitting the downvote button. But it still won’t make Moderna or Pfizer happen soon. masterstrokes of a mad man Incompetent fucks."

nkgsdu,"Isn’t it enough to ask “Introduce yourself” or “Introduce yourself and tell some interesting fact about yourself”. Why in the world would you specifically want to know my parents occupation? Seriously they ask “Tell me your name, where you are from and what do your parents do?” So you decide beforehand how to treat me for the rest of the fucking year??!! Fuck off with your classism!!","Seriously!! Teachers, why would want to know my parents occupation when I introduce myself?",Non-Political," To know their boundaries while punishing 😂. Some of them ask the same questions before admission so they can judge weather you can pay their fees or not. I remember when my 10th grade class-teacher concluded all by herself that i was being 'ill-treated' by my mother. My dad has been working outstation for many years. She crossed personal boundaries and made me embarrassed in front of the whole classroom. She was single in her 40's, She should've understood it's simply not her business how many times does my father visit us.. i cried that day ngl ..and don't forget the gossips which float around staffroom Everything that people ask you when they meet you, are directed towards evaluation.

My ex boss's boss wanted to know what my parents do and how much property I own, whether I have a gf, what her parents do and how much property they have. Thank you. 

Classism is deeply rooted in Indians and it doesn't seem it will be going anywhere anytime soon. Indians love to be high-headed about something or the other and class just happens to be the easiest option. This is sad as I remember something, in my classroom most of us came from middle class homes. One of the classmates came from a poor household, his father was a vegetable seller. I remember our classteacher in our first class, made us stand up and give our complete introduction, name, parents profession, previous class'% and I remember he mumbled couple of times and the teacher kept pushing him. Can't believe how embarrassing it must have been for him. In my school, there was this teacher who used to ask - What is your father?

We were supposed to answer his profession and this bright friend of mine replied 'My father is a human being'. Once I was in 6th class, one of my teachers said why I am frequently wearing the same civil dress. If you don't have clothes I will donate some of my sons clothes. 

And as a punishment she would tell to remove your shirt and kneel down in front of whole class or sometime throw away the shirt out of the window. In a couple of job interviews they've asked me my parents occupation and where they work. Why do you want to know? If it was a company/job you didn't like would that mean you won't hire me?

I told my parents and they were like it's how recruiters do 'character assessment'. Typical Indian mentality of poking their nose in everyone's life. Privacy is an alien concept here. So they can judge you for the entirety of your schooling. If you're someone from a wealthy background, they will treat you like a king and suck up to you because you might be able to help them. If you're poor and come from a non-influential family, they will treat you like scum and abuse you psychologically and physically. Welcome to India. :)"

I saw some discrepancy in some data. I thought I might have miscalculated something as I'm piss poor in math. Guess what? I better then the IAS officers running the govt. :p Times of India's comment section is such cancer. You try arguing with Bhakts this numbers and they will throw all kinds of data. Final tally will not match the production capacity and the number of people that are vaccinated. My inference is that the Government has not placed enough orders even now or there is a scam in the distribution to the private players. I live in Bangalore and for some reason couple of private Health care companies like Manipal hospitals and Apollo have a good number of vaccine dosage through the day. Their rates are exorbitant like Rs1200/ for Covishield while the MRP I believe is at least 3 times lesser. BJP’s IT cell is literally living in that comment section Read comments under it. Mind-blowing.

They are obese and have plenty of co-morbidities. 

Another friend is same, she was also very anti vaccine till her diabetic father tested +ve. Now she says she'll take it and het parents too.

This whatsapp University circulars about vaccines are bad will fucking kill us all. Yea you should visit Indian villages. People literally locking themselves inside their home when they see a vaccine worker. My mom went for second dose and there was barely anyone there. Now there is new rumour spreading among young people that vaccine will make them infertile so they are now running away too. You are assuming that we don't have anti vaxxers here.

It's worse with Ayurvedic remedies, Patanjali, homeopathy, home cures, steam therapy being seen as a cure by a large section of society.

All said, vaccines will *not*  instantly solve the current infection rates & may not keep up with a mutating virus . It still takes time to build up immunity and that also after 2 shots. 

What is also needed is ramping up the critical care infrastructure. Along with getting vaccines to all. It boils my blood when I see some nutjobs here in the US with signs that say that Covid is a hoax. There are lot of vaccines here but not enough people willing to take them. I live in WA state and now they have removed the requirement to book an appointment. Now you can walk in anywhere they have vaccines and get them. You say that but you guys are in the shit at moment for not wearing mask and doing event lol.(coming from Australian) Ironically, telling a Karen an Indian will get their vaccine if they don't take it will probably make them take it out of spite SII and Bharat Biotech deserved a better platform to raise funds for their production.

THe govt can still step in to allow/facilitate funding from the big players from various other sectors. I'm sure they would like a piece of this pie. We have our fair share of anti-vaxxers in India. I would say it's much more prevalent than America. Somehow these antivaxxers are mostly women who are overly religious. They think haldi water can solve anything.

Of the 121 newsroom leadership positions – editor-in-chief, managing editor, executive editor, bureau chief, input/output editor – across the newspapers, TV news channels, news websites, and magazines under study, 106 are occupied by upper castes, five by other backward classes and six by people from minority communities. The caste of four individuals could not be identified.

1. Three out of every four anchors (among a total of 40 anchors in Hindi channels and 47 in English channels) of debates are upper caste. Not one is Dalit, Adivasi, or OBC
2. For over 70% of their primetime debate shows, news channels draw the majority of the panellists from the upper castes
3. No more than 5% of all articles in English newspapers are written by Dalits and Adivasis. Hindi newspapers fare slightly better at around 10%
4. Around 72% of bylined articles on news websites are written by people from the upper castes
5. Only 10 of the 972 articles featuring on the cover pages of the 12 magazines under study are about issues related to caste.

According to [this](https://www.newslaundry.com/2019/08/02/caste-representation-indian-newsrooms-report-media-rumble-oxfam-india)

1. About 89% of leadership positions in English TV news channels belonged to the general category.
2. About 76% of flagship show anchors belong to the general category.
3. Only 5.6% and 1% of panellists across the surveyed channels belong to SC and ST categories respectively
4. For Hindi news channels 100% of leadership belonged to the general category and 80% of the anchors in primetime shows
5. On discussion of caste issues, 69% of the panellists belonged to the general category across all the surveyed channels.
6. Out of the 16,000 articles written by English newspapers between October 2018 and March 2019, about 60% were written by ""upper""-caste writers.
7. In Hindi newspapers, 56% of writers belonged to the general category, 8.1% to SC and 1.1% to ST categories.
8. Among digital media outlets, 84% of all leadership positions were occupied by those belonging to general category.
9. Articles regarding caste issues in digital media, 56% were written by those from general category.
10. Among magazines, 56% of total output come from general category writers 6.5% from SC/ST combined and 17 % from OBC category.

There is under-representation of Dalits in judiciary. According to [this](https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/india-news-70-years-of-indian-judiciary-opinion-composition-terribly-skewed-higher-levels-bastion-of-upper-caste-males/302658)

In the past 70 years, India only had just ONE Dalit Chief Justice. Currently there are no Dalit Chief Justice in high courts. According to [this](https://www.legallyindia.com/supreme-court/judiciary-remains-a-major-brahmin-bastion-no-sc-st-judge-has-been-elevated-to-apex-court-in-7-years-20180124-9045), no SC/ST person has been elevated to the supreme court in the past 7 years or now we can say 9 years since that was written in 2018.

In corporate also there is under representation, [93%](https://theprint.in/opinion/annihilate-of-caste-in-indian-corporate-possible-but-firms-must-say-dalit-lives-matter/444244/) of Indian cooperate board members belong to the ""forward""-castes, out of which Brahmins make up 45% and Vaishyas make up about 46%.

Similarly qualified SC candidates are less likely to be hired than the general category ones. [This](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40276548?seq=1) study shows that those with Dalit sounding names are 33% less likely to be hired and with Muslim sounding name are 67% less likely to be hired than someone ""upper""-caste sounding name.

There is also a huge income disparity by caste, for SC/ST people, their income is almost half of that of forward-castes. [Source](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Bharti2018.pdf) (page 17) Wealth/assets here is the indicator of presennce of 33 different durable household goods like TV, air conditioner etc.

|OBC|18.2|19.6|21.1|22.3|18.8|
|Other|9.4|15.4|18.4|22.8|34.0|

A score of greater than 20 means, there is larger representation of a social group in that quintile than overall for India. You can see the ""lower""-caste have a higher representation in the poorer quntiles. We can see that 50.1% and 70.7% and of the SC and ST households respectively are in the two poorest quintiles.

The overall wealth/asset [share](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/upper-caste-hindus-richest-in-india-own-41-total-assets-says-study-on-wealth-distribution-5582984/) of India's wealth is [heavily](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Wealth-Ownership-and-Inequality-in-India%3A-A-Tagade-Naik/79bd81b0ff05baea522755603a7bda6d5b403be5) concentrated among ""upper""-caste Hindus.

Disgusting About a month back, I had asked a lady to work as a cook at my place. She was upper caste and asked my caste before deciding to work here.

Irrespective of what my caste is, I refused to disclose it. She chose not to work. And I live in a metro city.

So pardon me for cringing at your arguments of ""caste doesn't exist in urban areas"" or ""it is about economic status and not social"". You are too privileged to understand caste if you haven't been rejected by an upper caste didi. This comment thread is worth the marked up popcorn they serve at movies Posting my thoughts here : 
We do see a lot of caste discrimination in rural areas even today. Don't forget this happens in urban areas as well. 

My family got a site which was completely surrounded by upper caste people. We had a huge issues to build house there (they just don't want an lower caste to stay among them , probably because we eat non veg??) 


Housekeeper asked us if we are Dalits as she doesn't want to work in lower caste ppl house (she eats non veg as well so it's not an issue with cleaning those utensils) 

Once people get to know caste in business world it's a misconception that lower caste are lazy and have come to this level because of reservations or other schemes. 

And obviously the last inter-caste marriage. 

It's really hard to find out who is deserving for reservation. If you go through income it's easily manipulated. I have seen few people show 1L / per annum as income. No matter what schemes government brings for reservation there will always be someone who is going misuse it. The only way to solve this problem is to increase the wages of these sanitation workers by a huge margin. Give them proper equipment. People shouldn't be ashamed to work as sanitation workers. As a result, more people would be tempted to work regardless of caste. 

In western societies, these sanitation workers are paid quite well, have proper protection and insurance. [removed] Bruh why does castesism even exist in this day and age? American here. How are people able to tell the different castes apart? How would someone know if someone else is below or above them? Wait what India still uses the caste system? I thought that was an ancient thing. Call me racist or whatever but the caste system seems a bit barbaric, it shouldn’t be used in modern countries."

jyt7et,"So WhiteHatJr Filed a 20 CRORE defamation lawsuit against me. 

1. The whole argument from their side is BS. 
2. They finally accepted that Wolf Gupta is imaginary. Why didn't they accept this earlier?
3. Check the document, and see for yourself all their hollow claims. The link at the end.
4. I am looking for lawyers. Got a lot of numbers. Talking to them right now. 
5. One good lawyer suggested I back out, sign an apology and end it, said will cost you 30k rupees only, and that's it. 
6. I won't back out. (Although my parents still don't know what mess I have indulged myself into. But I feel I will be able to handle them.)
7. Why did WhiteHatJr take this risky step? Like it seems like it won't go in their favor in public. Yet they took this desperate step. Because they know what I know and they want me to stop sharing it out there in public. Their lawsuit is to get interim junction and make me stop showing it to everyone. And even try to take down all my videos/posts/Reddit everything.
8. In the past 9 days, I tried if some big publication would write about it. But no one did. (Apart from one, Thanks to [Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/indias-whitehatjr-is-startup-hell/) and Ashish K Mishra for the article).
9. So what is it that they are trying to bury so hard?
10. This spreadsheet, the LIST of all the videos/tweets/links/posts/LinkedIn/Facebook/IG/ quora/Reddit/(9gag also) they reported and took down. The list contains over 700 such links. (If I included the comments of the parents that they were removing, the list would be over 2k)
11. Here is the List: Download, find these people, and tell them what happened to their posts. If your content was also taken down find it here: 
<As per court orders I have removed the link>

12. There is more. The whole company reeks of lies and deceit. Once I said I will find out who Wolf Gupta and who all these fictitious kids are. Now that the media is silent, here is the birth story of such kids and their 'apps'. And you tell me if I was wrong when I called this company a FRAUD. 

<removed after Delhi HC orders on 24/11/2020 >



Neither the kids existed, nor the apps. And they really created a $300 million company around it.

If that is now fraud what it? Now I think now you can understand why the threats, why this case, why they are talking so much risk but not looking at their own mistakes. This proof was shared with one journalist but they ignored it. Now you can understand why the media was silent.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, what do I do here? 

I have three options. 

1. Back out. Apologize and move on. Which I won't.
2. Hire a normal lawyer on my own and they would drag this case and make me exhausted. 
3. As seen in many tweets today, many of you asked me to start a fund and where all can chip in and hire the best lawyer possible. 

Please write in the comments which option should be taken. If option #3, please quote how much can you contribute for real, also suggest to me how to start a fundraiser and what platforms are good for it. WhiteHatJr has already spent 25 lakhs on preparing this case. So legal fights are costly. I alone can only go to a point until my pockets are empty. 

Thanks

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some requests:

1. PLEASE don't suggest me to contact Xyz, it takes time. Each email needs to be written accordingly. I would REALLY appreciate if you write emails to different journalist/YouTubers on my behalf. I am already running out of time. A lot has to be in the next few hours.
2. Some one please cross-post this in different subreddutts.
3. WRITE about this issue. Let's not wait for the media. I have posted most of the proofs on youtube and my Twitter. Please write blogs etc about this. Can someone also try to post this issue on LinkedIn, I am banned from there. 
4. Share etc do all that. You see how to spread this news now. Make a small poster kind of thing, those seem to work better than such long texts. 
5. I might not be able to reply to comments and DMs today, please don't mind.

Thanks again

**No kind of witch hunting or personal attacks or spamming will be tolerated in this thread or this subreddit. If anyone sees any such comment, please use report button or modmail us. Thank you.** You have hard evidence to support every claim you have made against them. You have no reason to fear. Don't let them intimidate you.

I will contribute to your fund but I believe your case is so clear that there will be law firms who will be willing to take this up pro-bono. Crosspost this to LegalAdviceIndia subreddit and seek their suggestions. Ask them to PM you instead commenting. These ORM hounds are most definitely sniffing around on reddit.

It might be worth checking with lawyers if there is a possibility of a class action lawsuit. If all parents who were cheated by this company come together to sue, that is a bigger threat to their model and they might rescind their defamation suit, which does not have much ground to stand on in the first place.

Lets find a permanent solution to this problem. Tell us what you need and we will all do this together. I'm seriously wondering why WHJ will go so far just for one random dude speaking against them. Like if they just let poonia say whatever he had to say against them, he'd be forgotten soon enough and WHJ can continue making money. People like you are fighting for my kids future.

I can contribute 1000 per month. Hi. You will not be able to back out. I have been a litigant myself. It is not like a contempt proceeding where you can just apologize and back out. 

There are lawyers who do for less amounts. They may not be a large law firm but will do the job. I have a lawyer who did my defamation matter for cheap in Delhi HC. It will drag on but that is not because of the lawyers necessarily. My lawyer doesn't play tricks, is sincere and did a decent job in getting me relief. She also did the matter based on my budget. Should you wish to avail of her services please let ne know I will share her number. 

Tomorrow you can just appear on your own and tell the court you need time to hire a lawyer. You will buy yourself and your lawyer some time. They will indulge you don't worry. 

You will need a lawyer who practices in Delhi. She appeared against a top firm for me alone. This got covered by News in shorts today. Just got a notification. Keep going pradeep. The goal is to get them bad publicity #Ultra quick tldr-

An ed-tech startup based in India that was acquired by $300M by BYJUS, another ed-tech startup using predatory marketing techniques.

##Why the hate?

[Misleading ads like these](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ec5DtiuXsAIekFa.jpg) and promising parents that their 10 yo can be turned into competent coders and charging them as high as $1500 for coaching classes. All the shit they sell is freely available on the internet. Worst part- their trainers are not even from programming background and know diddlysquat about coding.

#Since the post has hit front page, this is a reference for all non-Indians. 


**In Indian numbering system**

1 crore = 1,00,00,000 aka 10,000,000

so 20 crore = 200,000,000 

**Current USD to INR conversion**- 

1 USD= INR 74.16

therefore

INR 200M = USD 2,696,775.20

2.5M may seem measly to some but it is a friggin huge amount in India.

Sorry, didn't know my close friend Jack took that very seriously.. She legit called out for genocide and that's what it took for Twitter to finally suspend that dung brained asshole. It was suspended because she mentioned 2000s...lol Bhai how am I supposed to get my oxygen lessons now? Tooter and Koo will accept her happily. We won Mr. Stark #BoycottTwitter  incoming lmao So am I the only one who thinks someone from the BJP government got twitter to suspend her account?

She basically admitted that Modi is a thug (gundai)  and because of him the Gujarat riots happened. This caused Modi to be put on a no fly list for the USA (until OBAMA lifted the ban). 

Ever since then nationalists have been trying to reform his image in the era of Trump/Biden and US-India partnerships. 

I feel the Indian government didn’t like that and got her suspended because they want to protect his national image. 

I suppose she got a phone call telling her to stfu, and when she gets her account back, she’ll ramp up her typical “muh leftism/global media” charade and bury her older tweets.

I smell conspiracy my friends...and not just twitter responding to hate speech.🤔🤔 This is the best news I have heard this year. Rejoice my friends one less propagandist.

Howl in the name of our independence for which thousands of people sacrificed their lives but we tend to forget that to maintain that state of independence we need to keep fighting for it.

Howl in the name of wolf Gupta.

Howl for your freedom. I remember in your initial posts where some people were trying to demotivate you. You proved them all wrong. Sir, you are a true legend !! Respect !!! I think bad PR is feared by BYJU's.

Reddit amplified your case.  Congratulations. This deserves a show, a true David vs Goliath story. 
You have balls of steal man. Be the fking change you want to see. Remember this story guys. This all started right here on this subreddit only where I got the best support in those initial days. Thank you guys and the admins for all the support. When you first made the post here, I told you that going up against a big corporation is futile as they have a lot of resources. But you said that you weren't going to back down.

I'm so happy that you succeeded and proved me wrong! Wow!! This is BIG ! Best of luck to you Poonia Sir for your UPSC prep. India surely needs people like you in the system. Congrats to Pradeep! Always knew he was on the up and up. It would be great if the WhiteSlapJr could be counter-sued for defamation and emotional distress. These guys deserve to suffer and pay out punitive damages, IMHO. Kah ke li hai WhiteHatJr ki 
Salute for your resilience We won Mr Stark. Am I wrong in getting the sense that BYJUS is like an MLM scheme where u bring in more and more students and not a lot of quality education actually gets taught?"

Look at these people showing off their education, common sense, and human decency. After the pandemic you've got a sick gaming setup. This is some IT level shit and I completely support it. I am from kerala. I still am not able to comprehend how is this state able to do so much with so little and so many obstacles placed in front of it. Especially, when I see well funded states like UP and Delhi go through so much pain. Is it because the reported numbers from delhi and UP are drastically wrong? I’ve seen posts in other subs mocking “Kerala Model” when there was an uptick in cases. I can’t believe some people want the people of a whole state to suffer just because they do not agree with the politics of a state in the same damn country. Hope Kerala does a good job of handling the second wave. Fuck those assholes! All the comments below make Kerala sound like an Indian Wakanda. If they have some secret Vibranium or something now would be a good time to help others with it.

Edit: /s As a software engineer and a hardcore geek, I'm totally impressed. Really cool shit. I'm gonna shift to some hill station in Kerala and live the rest of my life there."

mdq4l9,,Cheat code,Non-Political," Meanwhile in comments: ""Love from India"" ""Foreigner Reacts to Indian Cinema""
*Shocked face in thumbnail*
3m views Yeah. They know how to do it well. I wish i could pretend to like some random thing across the world and get paid for it Exactly... This is what infuriates me... And all those stupid people who watch these... I've seen a lot ""Foreigner reacts to Indian movie/song/scene""... And all those cringe comments ""We love you"" and correcting something they said slightly wrong... Fucking grow up lads It's always same in pattern 
 1) First they react ( bang bang)
 2) The eat food 
 3) they ask people in street about India 
 And if they still get views 
  4) they might cook Indian dish or were Indian cloths Reaction videos on YouTube are the digital generation's plague. So many Indians are so desperate to hear a foreigner put in some good words about India in these videos and done!!! In less than a year they have 1 million subscribers and sponsorships. Low effort YouTubers. On the other hand so many incredible technology YouTubers (both Indians or otherwise) put in their blood sweat and tears, also years into their highly impressive videos and they hardly get any traction. I think we should create a list of great youtubers from India and update it frequently. What do you think guys? And the comments would be full of people who crave foreign attention. reaction videos go brrr ""Foreigner roasting what Indian hates"" is 25 din me subscribers double scheme for them.  


*like Samuel Miller who gained 100k subs from less than 10k within a week by roasting WhiteHat Jr.* Lmaoo I'm glad so many people recognise this too lol, how do those low effort vids have so many views and million of Indians watching it. As a kid i was also focused on foreigners, and did not know anything about my own culture. 
Studied for NID tests, had to read whole art and culture. INDIA IS FCKIN BEAUTIFULLL, I REPEAT. I hope we come to appreciate our own country and people more than hoping others appreciate our culture."
mwmo5b,,"Since Modi loves to be limelight, I photoshopped him at the places he should be at instead of rallies.",Satire," This guy wanted to put his face on the vaccination certificates. 

They should put his face on the death certificates these days. More of them circulating around.... I've never felt such a visceral dislike towards a politician. Like, seriously, what do people see in this fraud? BJP folks will use the first picture, "" modiji visited hospitals every hour"". *IT cell wale wants to have you in their team* can you do the joker in front of the hospital ? The 1st picture looks like he's walking away from the doctors.

2nd One looks like he's smiling while ignoring the people dying.

3rd One looks like he is walking away from the suffering person to attend rallies.

4rth One looks like he is smiling at how people are dying in covid. Make another series where he’s taking a selfie with morbid backdrops. This is 100% amazing, I just subbed to /r/India by chance. I see now it was worth it. I just hope you don't get charged with sedition 😂😂 I am almost certain that if he starts ‘helping’ the situation would be much worse.  I am leaving this country. There is no hope here. I have been paying  direct and indirect taxes, and still don't have acess to basic  healthcare facilities."
ngzbch,,"[Remics Comics] ""Lockdown is not same for all.""",Coronavirus," I can feel both pics, since I'm working from home for an IT company on other hand my father is an auto drive and not working right now, he don't speak but I can see in his eyes the guilt that all responsibility are on my shoulder. This cartoon hits hard. Many people easily forget that a major chunk of Indian population still lives hand to mouth and this pandemic has been an absolute calamity for them. 

Govts need to start pumping in support money to their bank accounts otherwise the pandemic will force these poor people to take bad steps. My family would have been on right side but i somehow grew up preety fast to handle this burden. So true! Every time I see such photos or cartoons, I’m filled with shame and guilt. This is such a sad reality. 😞 Are there any initiatives out there that we can contribute to? Lost my job right at the end of 2019, court case on the same pending, jobless, with aged parents and kid as dependent, if not for my spouse id be in penury. Injustice keeps getting multiplied in this crisis. hoping that the system makes room for justice and welfare This needs to be DMd to all those insensitive fucks saying: “we are in the same boat” We need UBI as of yesterday.

Not the how do you have so much energy despite sleeping 4 hours a day type questions. Misleading title. 

The BBC reporter didn't ""grill"" him but I so wish she had. I have so many questions - how is this clown a spokesperson for the ruling party? He can’t even seem to form comprehensible sentences that answer a simple question. The defense is the same old beaten horse...sovereignty, Indian internal affair. He called her blind twice in under three minutes. ""YoUr inForMaTion is cOmplEtely inCorRecT..."".Lol I died Oh wow - ""Copied and pasted"" tweets. BJP are such a victim. Awww. Reading from a script and the news person was being polite. These guys openly lie without any shame.

n0c04k,So my beloved dad and mom just passed away from covid in the hospital today. Im almost sleepless for almost a week. Uh those last moments i dont want to remember them ill literally faint.  and im absolutely heart broken i was more of a family guy than a friend guy i just do not know what to do in life anymore i dont want to live anymore why would i live to suffer? I would just take my life and meet my parents back in the heaven. And i just have my uncle in delhi who also passed away from covid a few months ago. What will i do i cant pay or know how to pay rent or im just clueless this is the effect after rallying during a pandemic. Just sad any reccomendation on how to die in not a painful way?.,So my mom and dad both passed away of coronavirus (covid 19) and i just really dont see the point of living anymore,Unverified," I am really sorry to hear this. From a random stranger for what it's worth, I am here if you want to talk. We really need a thread/post on what to do in an unfortunate situation like this. How to do the paperwork, formalities, get finances in order, insurance etc. Are you there op ? There is no reply from your side please respond The only way is to live and fight until your last moment.
1. Find food to eat, don’t starve. There are NGOs in all major cities supplying food packets on the road.
2. If you have no way to pay rent, first try to buy time from the landlord.
3. Take death certificates for both your parents. After all this is over, the government should provide ex-gratia to affected children and families. This will come but it will take a long time. Make sure the cause of death is written as Covid-19 on the death certificates. This is very important.
4. Check if your dad and mom have life insurance policies or health insurance policies, apply for those with copies of death certificates. This work will be within a month’s time. No rush. If you want to check, call the life insurance company and confirm how to apply for the policy withdrawal. Read the policy also if you can. It will keep you informed.
5. If your dad was government employee, immediately call his colleagues and tell them what happened and ask for help. Any money will help you. For government employees, there will be bereavement related employment provided, but that also takes time. You should be given his job in a year’s time. You will be able to find this information more later on.

Take one day at a time my friend and fight through. Do not get into any trouble by doing any illegal acts. Everyday make sure that you feed yourself and you are well rested. You will respect yourself when you come out of this in a couple of years. I really hope you do. I am so sorry for your loss brother. Lost my Dad a few months ago and the prolonged ordeal has left horrifying scars on me. You never want to see your loved ones gasping for breath and struggling for life. I'm a shadow of a person that I was before losing my dad. But, let me tell you it gets better. It gets tolerable. You can never really get over losing your parents. But, it becomes less hurtful over a period of time. Take baby steps brother. One day at a time. Push away any dark thoughts you are having. Again, one day you will find the will to live and a reason to live. Till then hang on. If you want to vent out or need some one to talk to, I'm no expert but I would be willing to hear you out and talk as I've been through it all as well. Pls do not fall in to the trap of negative thoughts. Keep pushing. We are here for you. He is not replying any of the comments. I've a really bad feeling for this. His profile doesn't have any useful information about him either. If you want you can come stay with me for a few months. Feel free to dm me if you want to have a call.

Not to be preachy but just want to say that if you grow out of this, you'll be so resilient throughout your life and that you'll be invincible. You have a whole life ahead of you full of potentialities. Can some some track him down ? He hasn’t responded at all to anyone ? From his posts seems like a 16 year old kid ? Hope he is fine I think you should not think of dying as your parents made a lot of sacrifices to keep you alive and healthy. I cannot fully understand or imagine what you must be going through but your death is the least thing that your parents would like you to do.

They would rather want you to be strong and stay alive to do great things in life. We are all capable of doing great things, you are too.

You deserve happiness, a lot of it. You deserve everything that is good and pure in this world. This moment shall also pass with time. Right now everything will look dark to you but trust me when I tell you that things will get better. Don't look at the world as a toxic place because it isn't, there's both good and bad in this world and there's a lot of good stuff for you to experience.

If you know anyone, like a friend, relative, neighbour then talk to them. Have someone around to talk to. You need emotional support and counseling and there's plenty of that available. It is a traumatic experience and you cannot keep it buried inside you.

Edit: added a few more motivational things Hey I/cjj10109 - 

Don’t know if you’ll read this. 

Not sure if it is realistic for you but you could come live with me (single dad) and my son in California (USA) - he is just graduating 12th grade and starting junior college in the fall (will continue living at home )

He is really into video games and D&D

There is a really good high school across the street you could attend. (Very safe and modern/progressive) plus it is one of the highest ranked high schools in California. 

I don’t have a lot of money but would be happy to let you share our home (condo rental), food, etc

You would be welcomed and given opportunity to grieve but also grow and learn in a supportive household. 

May not be what you prefer to do but I just had to offer. I wish I could bring your parents back

Either way I hope you see all these messages and feel free to reach out to just talk if you want. 

I know for sure that your parents would want you to go on living and becoming the person you dream of - it would truly break their hearts if you hurt yourself. Remember one thing. The last thing your parents would want is you killing yourself. Your parents who meant everything for you, would want you to live on and fight."
nhnkwf,,Crocodile Tears,r/indiameme," When people in Varanasi were dying outside hospitals, there was no oxygen or ventilators or beds, a mother was forced to take the dead body of her son (who died because he could not get medical attention) by herself on an e-rickshaw, 100+ dead bodies were burning in the cremation ghats each day. At that time the MP of Varanasi was in West Bengal, in a rally, praising the crowd that had gathered in such large numbers. Cry as much but this won't be forgotten. Look how you made the crocodile cry. Why did you insult him by comparing the tyrant to him? hospital me hamare doctor ladre hay. National Geographic Channel on Tata Sky can be found on 709 (SD) Channel 708 (HD).  
Thank you all. Inky pinky ponky  
Country’s run by donkeys  
People died,  
Head Donkey cried,  
Inky pinky ponky. Is anyone surprised by this?? They are basically trying every trick in their arsenal to save their image - riots, blaming the people, denial, creating fake toolkits, crying - but unlike in the past this time it's not sticking.

I predict that, sooner or later, someone from BJP is going to end up becoming a scape goat. Can we start a petition to get this actor a star on the Hollywood walk of fame? Maunendra Dramodas Modi Modixi’s tears are sending a chill down the crocodile’s spine. He didn't say jack shit when doctors and nurses were getting beaten up so I really don't give a fuck what he has to say. Too little too late Smriti irani's acting classes helping them now"
gx3r7p,"I'm a dark skinned south Indian guy born in early 80s. Throughout my existence, Indian people have commented on my dark skin. I've been called everything from Kalu, Kariya to African, Ugandan, Ambrose (somehow that was supposed to be a an insult). I've been asked (forced when I was younger) to use curds, milk, Fair and Lovely, Fairever, Fair and Handsome, Vanishing Cream, cold cream, etc., on my face to make me fairer

Some girls that I expressed interest in told me explicitly that they can't date me because their parents would never approve of a dark skinned guy (many other rejected me for reasons that were not this but that's irrelevant). Shaadi.com and BharatMatrimony.com profile pictures of mine were touched up by a ""professional"" because nobody wants a dark guy. Many women that I met through these websites also had gone through the same experience. It is funny how many similar experiences two dark skinned Indian people have had regardless of their education, wealth, etc., 

My mom, my very own mother discouraged me from going out in the sun too long in the fear that my skin would get darker; of course, she had her own demons to fight with that came from being dark skinned. An aunt would literally differentiate between her two girls as the ""fairer one"" and the ""darker one"". The list goes on... Ironically, it took me moving to the US for people close to me to stop talking about my skin colour on a constant basis

And now I see all these ""righteous"" Indian folks on Indian social media about how America is a hellhole where riots happen, racism happens, their friends had been racially profiled by White people and that we Indians should move back to our own country and escape racism in a racist Western country. And I can help but laugh at the irony. These were and are the same people that still comment about my skin colour  on the WhatsApp group for family or friends or for high school friends or for college friends but when I called them out, all I get is someone who tries to calm me down by saying ""They're your friends/family. They don't have bad intentions""

Fuck off!","Dear Indian society, you do not possess the moral high ground to criticize racism in any other country",Non-Political," Even though what we Indians experience in our country is 'colour-ism' or whatever, it's also true that Indians are incredibly racist against black people. We've seen that in so many movies and what not!

I've felt like Indians have an inherent hierarchy in their minds based on color. When I was coming to the US for my education, my mother told me what almost all mothers say, but with a twist, ""don't bring home any black guys"". I asked her if its ok if I bring home white guys, and she was like ""but why would white guys want you, you're darker than them. It's black guys who you should be worried about"".

Can't argue with that logic! /s Lol, we're a nation full of hypocrites and sheep. With a small minority who see things as they are. [removed] I spent much of my childhood hating my dark skin - because of the jokes/nicknames I had acquired because of my color.

I think I was around 16-17 years old, when I started to stop giving a damn about assholes around, responding to slurs about my color, with slurs about their color. You’re right, we’re shit people that’s just how it is. It is easy to put up a black lives matter post in your story just because everyone is doing so. Looking inwards, we will discriminate against a person on the basis of just about anything — colour of skin, your body, your language, your accent, your religion, your caste and all of your choices. 

I’m considerably fair skinned and hail from the national capital but if someone says to me north Indians are shit people I’ll agree with them, we north Indians are shit people when it comes to accepting differences. It bewilders us that two different persons can have different features and different choices.

All those people putting up stories about the US protests and elephant deaths will never look inwards at the various people from so called backward classes and Muslims who’re lynched to death everyday. When they talk about police brutality they don’t talk about UP police that fires onto peaceful protestors and indefinitely detains them, they don’t talk Delhi police that detains 21 week pregnant Safoora Zargar and denies her bail. All this is invisible to them. 

I know north Indians who hate south Indians and vice versa, I’ve tried reasoning with them both to no effect. 

So when you or anyone else says this, I agree with you, we are shitty self-serving people that don’t even try to change. Racism is plain ignorance and we have many of those in India including the educated elite. 

To me what bothers most is not racism but opportunism associated with the racism. Indians may be the most well behaved and idealistic race when under someone sort of overpowering figure but the minute given an open leash they turn opportunistic and become the most dehumanized race.

I may not been able to word it correctly here though. In Hindu mythology many gods are described to have darker skin tone. I guess this obsession towards fairer skin tone accelerated due to colonialism. Black Lives Matter but Bahu toh Gori hi chahiye hume. Throughtout my High school and into higher secondary, i was called Nelson Mandela or Monday  for short.

When i was younger , this used to piss me off to no bound. Then i read about thia guy and i started feeling a sense of pride. I owned the name, i made it my own. My jerseys have that name printed. 

Racism is rooted deep into people in India.
A fair person will call a brown guy Kalu, that brown guy will cal a even darker shade of brown guy Kalu. 

Fake wokeness is bad for every individual out there, cause they have not suffered it, but people who have will be double pissed off cause no one stood up for them when it happened. 

Its all surface level, im telling you in another two months, these guys will be back to their hypocritt self. You won’t believe this.. but ever word is true. 

My wife is ABCD and I moved here 10 years ago. After marriage in one of those meet and greet events at her uncles place, the conversation slipped through into social inequality and racism. 

Her uncle, in front of 20 odd people , that brown and white people said “I just don’t like black people because, their face looks burnt and the head shape is similar to gorilla” 

Yup, like a gorilla and looked around for validation. And a bunch of fat cousins nodded. 

The only way to cure them of racism is death. We’re a couple of generations away from this prejudice to go away. Pee Cee and Yami Gautam endorse Racism in India"
mle5cv,,BYJUs putting 14 y/o kids into guilt.,Business/Finance," The whole scam is in their refund guarantee.They have to act like a teacher for the refund period. The child is told that they will get a tab. The child guilts his parents about getting the tab for education purposes which he will use for online gaming. They are not selling education. They are selling refurbished tab for 10 times markup Bought a 3 year thingy from them when i was moving to class 10th. Recorded videos from 10th were decent but 11th and 12th videos are just trash. I haven’t used it in a year. Mentors are basically only for logistical stuff and communications. We were told mentors would help with doubts. That was a lie. Some videos are really crappy and just have a guy solving some problems on paper with trash audio quality. 

I payed 50k for the 3 year course and the tab. Have heard people are paying lakhs/year now. Biggest scam of the decade. Well can't his parents approach Bank and cancel EMI ? If they had paid with Credit Card. Think of the long-term psychological impact this guilt could leave on the kid. And why are these BYJU's subscriptions are for multiple years? If their product is any good, make it monthly. Imagine paying for Netflix for multiple years at once and once payment is done, you CAN NOT cancel the subscription.  Then would they give any good movies/services?

Byjus now sell up to 6 years of course at once, earlier they even used to sell directly for 10 years!

This is just the tip of the iceberg, this issue of Byjus is way bigger. And again, the ENTIRE MEDIA is silent like nothing is happening at all.

If anyone of you or your known is trying to get a refund from Byjus, feel free to contact me, will do everything possible to get your money back.

UPDATE (3:00 am): Byjus took down this kid's profile. Fuck BYJUs BYJU owns Aakash, WhiteHat Jr., Meritnation etc. and they're literal pieces of shit, making money out of people. Everyone use [www.khanacademy.org](https://www.khanacademy.org)

completely free and the creator Salman Khan (not selmon boi) is a bong 

please donate if you get the chance to do so I can understand that...back then my parents also bought that same package and all was gud for a month or so after which it started getting worse and worse....it was just like they were not solving my problems but increasing them and when we asked the costumer care that we want to discontinue they said that there will be no refund after which i stopped watching those videos....now its been a year and a half sice we bought it and now also the mentor calls to know why am i not watching the videos...afterall the outcome is dont buy byjus its just waste of money which many parents dont understand and fall right into the trapof such companies.. BYJU will probably be the shittiest and most toxic thing that will ever happen to India and Indian education. They had the opportunity to revolutionize our education system and bridge the education and digital gap in our country. Rather, they are utilizing every opportunity to capitalize on the broken system for their own profits. They're really not different from the very coaching institutes they say they're different from. Fucking guilt shaming parents and students on missing out on the 'big thing' or 'future CEO', making parents give up their savings so that their child can get 'quality education'. How is it not a scam? 

BYJU, White hat, and similar other 'Ed Tech' companies are all nothing but profit mongerers and I hope people, especially the younger generation, comes to senses quickly and wipe them out of this fucking business. in the era of youtube, khanacedmy and many others  talented, smart people who share their knowledge at free of cost then why people still buy this shitty app subscription? 4000 Rs EMI. It's fucking debt trap."
mzjopf,,"Ostriches don't bury their heads in sand, Indian Govt does - The Telegraph",Politics," When the government is more concerned about it's 'image' than about it's citizens you know somewhere we as citizens have messed up badly. I guarantee you that, when India does recover from this horrible tragedy, Modi and his minions will statues of themselves and parade around India and the world saying they defeated the apocalypse.

Edit: thank you for the awards! The Australian : What is the situation in India?

Reporter : Shit is really bad!

The Australian : Give us the truth, we will print it.

The reporter does the work, tells the truth and the Australian prints it.

GOI : OH NO! THEY ARE PRINTING THE TRUTH! WE MUST SEND LETTER AND TELL THEM THAT YOUR TRUTH IS YOUR TRUTH AND NONE OF OUR TRUTH! This is how China replies when foreign media makes some comments, but generally through their propaganda ""newspaper"" Global times.  
They at least have the courtesy to pretend that nothing is being directed from the government but looks like the Modi govt doesn't even have an ounce of shame. I hope not only those who lost their loved ones and faced hardships but also the one who can face this hardship any time vow to never vote for this government. Took rojgar of 2crore pakodawalas too. This Government has gone beyond shamelessness...

There are lines in Crematorium, People are dying gasping for breaths, Hospitals sending SOS each day cause of Oxygen shortage... Everyone can see all this with their fucking wide open eyes... Yet, Government tries to defend itself, I mean, No self respecting person or entity would do that, But Modi Government doing it, anyway... 

Yogi says No oxygen, bed shortage in UP, Harshavardhan says no Vaccine shortage in country, Piyush Goyal says Maths didn't help Einstein discover Gravity, Nirmala says she don't eat Onions so she don't care about its prices, Modi says 'Waah Modiji Waah'...

Hypocrisy bhi kitna expose kare inka? Nange hai Yeh log, koi Sharam nahi... Wonder how Modi and the BJP are going to try to cover up all these reports from foreign media @u/otterwisespend care to comment? You wanted proof, here it is. India is fucking burning and all you care about is your dirty nationalist agenda. Filth of the world you are I am just wondering how the BJP will go after the Telegraph if we lose Bengal. I mean it will probably just bomb the Telegraph and the Bengali newspapers. At least The Australian has a fucking spine."

Or else our future generations will curse us. Actually the dirtbag is a very useful part of a vaccum cleaner It's very sad that we are abusing the nature. The future generations will curse. We have no right to ruin the place for them. It's not as if Mumbai beaches were any cleaner before the cyclone. Petition for redditors of r/India in Mumbai to meetup and clean the beaches in teams. This could have been such a lovely beach. If only, we learnt to build our cities to respect nature and our surroundings. Everytime this is blamed on average joe, I link this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koqNm_TgOZk

Corporates moved to plastics to reduce cost and increase profits then blames the people for littering them. Beyond boycotting, or not littering what can the common people even do to overturn this. It should not ideally be NGOs or the govt's responsibility either as thats our tax money used to fix a problem corporates created.

Blaming people not to litter, not to get addicted to alcohol, sugar, facebook, snapchat, video games, be adarsh balak when the very capitalist system wants you to consoom them and get addicted. As individuals, we can only try not to litter but makes little change if the corporations keep generating more litterable products. ""Take it back...again. - Mumbai"" This happens every monsoon. I think it's a good cycle, at least this waste can be taken away Yeah, let's keep using the sea as a dumpster ignoring the ecological impact. Like nature just keeps watching you without consequences.

Nature 1, Us 0 Life's simpler and cleaner in the mountains. it has fair share of inconveniences during winters and rain but the rest of the year makes up for these 2-3 bad months. But seriously i have not seen dirtier beaches than the ones in Mumbai. Been to a lot of beaches in india and they are mostly clean."
mil3pj,,Baby's Skin Colour,Non-Political," Not only babies. Bride, groom, bf , gf too! Not only India almost all south east Asian countries are like this.
It's really sad hope it improves in the future. As a dark-skinned person born to light-skinned parents can confirm I live in Tamilnadu. I can tell you that most of my sighted friends drool over girls with lighter skin. Same goes for parents. If someone is lightskinned, they are called beautiful. As an African-American, let me add my opinion that **COLORISM SUCKS** I’m Scottish, can you tell me what Indians fuss about in regards to babies skin colour? Lol I spent about 2/3rd of my life (I'm 21 right now) in the North in Delhi and Jammu (originally from Odisha) as my dad is in BSF and the amount of name calling and shit I've endured in school makes me kind of sad but laugh. My initial school days in Jammu were filled with bullying. Part of the reason I have social anxiety now but I still don't know, if the bullying was because I was new and introverted in nature, my skin tone or a combination of both..... :/ Things did get better with time though as I made more friends. Sometimes I think what the foreign students from African countries have to endure here in India Why didn't someone make this as soon as the interview came out.  Mann damn this is on point Indian shit. Indian movies and other entertainment forms still host the so-called jokes where the sole object of comedy is the dark skin-color of a side character. Or let a character smitten by not the beauty of a woman but by her 'fair skin color'.

Many criticize corrupt dark-skinned politicians, not just for their corruption, but also go on and mock their dark skin color equating dark-skin with corruption/low-moral-values/stupidity etc. It's common even in South India! (for example, HD Kumaraswamy in Karanataka.)

A victim of sexual assault/rape/other violence gets very less media attention if she is dark-skinned (of course, unless the case is is a proxy for attacking a different problem like misgovernance, but the face of the victim will not be shown much though).

And dark-skinned people face small discrimination every single day while traveling, shopping, and whenever they show up outside their home. [deleted] Well I hope they don’t cancel india /s"
lt7bdc,,Arranged marriage problems,Culture & Heritage ," I feel like saas bahu stuff is always about insecurity brought upon by competition of perceived limited resources - the sons attention, love and financial security. If the saas did not depend only on her son for financial and old age security a lot of animosity would be prevented. That is just my observation of a lot of mothers of sons. There isn’t anything special why mothers of daughters aren’t as territorial over their daughters it’s just that sons are upheld to a totally different value in our society. As my father says we are not your safe deposit you are not our retirement pension 

Do stuff on your own like we did 

And I appreciate this talk My mother had 2 arranged marriages and the first person ran away with a girl 2 months after I was born and the second assaulted her and she still forces me to get arranged married. Arranged marriages are whatever, if BOTH parties agree and are NOT forced to agree. But 99% are FORCED. Why do parents and elders still have control over their children when they become self sufficient? From my limited experience of interacting with elder people, I can say that they're not aligned with current generation. They expect that the ""bahu"" will take care of them while their son is working. Essentially a servant sorts of. I might be very wrong here, but most of them say this "" abh tere maa baap ka khayal kon rakhega"". This is actually a really grave matter. TV serials convince the 'saas' of 'bahu' being their enemy. My mother suffered a lot cuz my grandmother was an avid watcher of these shit shows and I wish things would've been like how they were supposed to be instead of how they went, But the past is the past. I don't like where this is going. Mum: it's over son! I have the high ground! THIS IS THE WAY!! People should learn to differentiate between arranged marriages and forced marriages before they start making assumptions. लुल"

UPDATE AT 2 PM - Zinda

UPDATE AT 3:37 PM - Zinda

UPDATE: 5:52 PM - Zinda

UPDATE: 7:49 PM - Zinda

FINAL UPDATE: 10:52 PM - Zinda, so I’m guessing I’m going to be okay. Much thanks to all bhratas and matas for care and support. You forgot the rule about making pregnant women sit inside dark rooms. Be prepared for the inevitable “Solar eclipse mutates Karona” explanations and forwards. I am not even allowed to use the toilet here. Something something cosmic rays, fermentation, poison bullshit. A jain retard living in my 3 storeyed building told me to bath after 2 pm and then only must I light my stove. I've already drank tea for my morning pressure. Now all i have to do is to masturbate at the right moment to gain unimaginable super powers. Even the educated are falling for this shit. My one room mate is deep into this. He's telling us to not eat anything from 10 am to 2 pm. Tulsi patta is allowed though. He's apparantly a Mechanical Engineer. Since he's the one who feeds us on weekdays when we work so i guess i have to do a small fast today😂😂

Update : he saw me struggling to watch the eclipse through my Tupperware water bottle ( i couldn't find anything else) even though he specifically warned us not to.🤣🤣 Windows 10 or 8? Be specific next time. Guess I’ll just starve till this gets over This is gold. 😂

And I am going to bath and then eat at 12 P.M.

&#x200B;

I was right down to every comma, but it would've been better if I had lost. That's the propagandas of respective government. Their priority, in turn, is selling the propaganda.

UP wants it's people to believe Ram Mandir is a victory, WB wants people to believe TMC is building educational infra. Both are fiction. BC....i thot the rishi muni is coding. If you expand your thinking, you'll know who won this
 
People want UP model not WB model, that's why the priority.
  
Edit: guess what? UP's tableau actually won.
 https://indianexpress.com/article/india/ram-temple-republic-day-uttar-pradesh-7165567/ Ram Mandir is probably their biggest achievement. 

Given Yoginath reputation they should have shown ""burning Unnao rape victim surrounded by UP police"" Looks like one tableau of Mamta Didi and one of Modiji BJP wants nation to be dumb and colored in religious fervour People seem to have forgotten Delhi Tableaux but remembered UP tableaux. Priorities? hmm. Lets talk about the elephant it the room  
Why are they not aerodynamic? Bhakt logic : they're the same picture

P. S:   WB government has no priorities, just like UP government or any other  government. You have to be a kid or retarded to fall for their shitty virtue signalling. [removed]"

hfzyar,,The lawyers who got India to legalise homosexuality will now push for same sex marriage,Politics," While I don't want to underplay their achievements, and the good work they did, I think it is worth pointing out that the battle to decriminalise homosexuality was a long one and fought by many lawyers, not all of whom had the political connections (SC Judge uncle, BJP spokesperson dad) as those mentioned in this article. 

Over the last few years I've seen the lawyers mentioned in this article give a lot of interviews in which you get the kind of clear impression that they single-handedly decriminalised homosexuality. But the reality is the struggle was lead by an organisation called Naz Foundation, directed by Anjali Gopalan, and represented by Anand Grover, at the Delhi High Court in 1991 - when neither of these lawyers were even parties to the case. The Alternative Law Forum in Bangalore did a lot of work to draft the petitions that ultimately led to this outcome. A boutique law firm in Delhi did drafting for these lawyers, and senior advocates like Ashok Desai (former AG) lead oral arguments for them in the case. The judgment itself acknowledges the contributions of many lawyers apart from these two.

A victory like this was a team effort and it would be nice to see the media acknowlege the less famous but no less important lawyers and activists (And the group of students!) who worked towards this. We have a tendency in India to make heroes out of anyone who is visible and good at PR (just look at our current political leadership). That is not always an accurate picture and often elides the good work done by people who aren't good at twitter.

https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/how-these-men-and-women-in-black-fought-for-rainbow-against-section-377-1869825.html How amazing would it be if these kinds of progressive changes actually came about politically and democratically from the majority of the population and their voted representatives rather than legal challenges to the law. I guess that would sign of real progress in the Indian populace, but maybe I'm expecting too much.. 

This will still be great, regardless of how it comes about. Fun fact! The duo lawyers that worked towards chucking section 377 in India are also a lesbian couple :) I did a case study on them in college. Great team. This will be good for the marriage industry,  more money and jobs . Now there going to have arranged gay marriages I wish, and dream for a better India, one where all are treated equally, both in law and as fellow Indians and humans. Stan We need more people like her! the problem is even if same sex marriage become legal, it will be only on paper. just like gender equality laws and other things. Majority of population is still LGBT+phobic. And most wont accept homosexual relationships even if legal. Many don't even accept inter caste, inter religion or just any heterosexual love marriages. Do you think they will be ok with homosexual marriage? It will fail. Same sex marriage petitions will be easily dismissed in Indian courts not due to the conservative character of the court but that it would constitute judicial overreach. It is upto the legislature to do it."
kdvfxl,,That's how India was meant to be.,Politics," The is not the India ""that is meant to be""... This is the India they don't want us to see... 

Increasing communal tensions and news of fanatic (read 'pathetic') individuals has made us believe that the fanatics are the norm

Most of India is like this... They just don't want us to see random acts of kindness, regardless of faith... they don't want us to believe that 95% of the country is comprised of good people, showing everyday kindness to everyone. I think someone needs to make subreddit for pictures like this The lack of masks is concerning. This is how I’ve always seen India as. 

When it comes to religion, I’ve grown up in a Catholic neighbourhood in Mumbai. Only one Muslim family among us and as a child I remember sitting with this family when they would break their fast during Ramadan. They had a big thaali with fruits, dried fruits and nuts and they would all sit around and eat it together. I was always welcome and the aunty used to feed me as well. At least 3-4 times a week I was part of their ritual because I was great friends with the kids. Till date they send us biryani on various occasions. 

Meanwhile in school my best friend (till date) is Hindu. We used to stay over at each other’s places and grew so close. She would come with me to church and I used to explain what was happening. I would go with her for puja and she would explain stuff to me. They included me in all their religious celebrations. I’ve been to so many dandiya nights and visarjans and felt very included every single time. My parents didn’t get outraged and hers didn’t either. 

Today, people are filled with hate and hatred is promoted more than anything. People are outraging on social media because a bunch of cops were recorded in Santa hats while eating cake. They’ve been abused for something as asinine as that. A hat and cake. 
Not to mention, Santa hats (and other Christmas related stuff) are sold on the streets by little children in the month of December. 

You don’t lose your faith by sharing/appreciating or respecting someone else’s belief. You do shred your humanity when you insult and attack someone for it. This comment section is the perfect representation of what is wrong in our society. Nobody wants conflict, most people don't want some religious theocracy, but most people also don't care enough to act against an autocratic uprising. 




Like always, the privileged class decides what narratives to push, they decide who is patriotic, national or anti-national. And many of these conservatives (not pinning on any one religion) are happy calling for genocide, smirking behind their computer screens, as if they did something exemplary to protect their so called ""religious/cultural"" identity. Because when you idiots wage war, you perfectly well know that it's the poor who die. 



The conservatives force pride, for whatever culture they belong to, down their throats, a culture they had no contribution in building, their pride is the only thing that gives them confidence, because of the validation they get from their echo chamber. So yeah, all of you ""culture warriors"" please keep doing whatever pathetic little you need to push your narrative. It isn't the biryani or pizza that bothers them. This unity is what that bothers them only Muslims and Sikhs..  no Hindus.  ／s As Mark Twain said, ""Religion was born when the first conman met the first fool."" Yes, this is what India is suppose to be, and should still be. People need to remember that India is split up on a map rather randomly by Lord Mountbatten in 2 days, who couldn’t be bothered with the locals, and  the consequences, and just drew a line. Wholesome. I enjoyed this post. Like Kunal Kamra said: ""Who's demanding a Hindu rastra? I've only ever seen it being promised."""

Mumbai's municipal corporation makes the most amount of money in taxes as compared to other MCs doesn't it? Man this is Kings circle, things get pretty bad here every monsoon. Hope he is well. This picture perfectly embodies the spirit of the politician. Never address the problem that the public face, only address those that your rich friends and you yourself face. This is the state of COVID people on this platform rarely see. Most of us are working from home in our comforts. A big chunk of our country consist of people like Ashok, whose lives have come to a standstill. No support from the government. No universal healthcare even if they get Covid. They have to risk it all to open their shop and Mother Nature fucks them even harder. Heartbreaking to see. There seems to be no end in sight. How will these people eat? As mumbaikars. We are broke. The spirit is broken. The lifeline is shut. 

Trains are not working. Not everyone can afford ola. Realestate and rents are touching the sky.

Zero income, huge expense. And about the number of cases per day. Well what should I say.

The rain here is terrible. Its like Satan playing some game. No mercy rain, every year.
The roads flow away, the market is washed away. We see trees and buildings falling. Don't even ask about the slum areas.

We don't have the liberty to complain. Coz the ruling party is state's favourite. We just sleep like that. Get up next morning. And go to work. Be it heavy rain, be it a terrorist attack, or a pandamic. 

Typing from my office. Had to drive here through 3 feet water.

Ps: the stories your grandfather tells you when he was young. We live it! Harappan civilization was way better than contemporary civilization. Spirit of Mumbai, spirit of Bengaluru, Spirit of India, etc., Are just things that the privileged people make up to make themselves feel like everything is okay

The daily wage workers, the homeless people, those being forced to beg don't benefit from this dumbass ""spirit of XYZ"" and are constantly reminded of the apathy that this country's rich show towards the downtrodden and poor The flood comes every year. Whether it's in Mumbai, Bihar, Assam, Delhi or other places. Why government doesn't do something to fix this? I'm sorry. This is no spirit of Mumbai, this is a picture of public massively failed by the governance. Mumbai has been flooding since decades and nothing has changed. Life has no value it seems.

People do everything in their power to stave off misery and keep themselves afloat (literally right now!) And media calls this miserable standard of existence the ""Mumbai spirit"". At this point, this cliched label is just disrespectful. Shit Sena has been at the helm of municipality affairs, for more than three decades.

But same story year after year.

> Just like many others in the city, Singh, a resident of Kurla and a father of two, had opened his business on Wednesday after being driven to penury during the lockdown -- one of his two daughters lost her job and the family exhausted all its savings. But within hours the street outside the shop was flooded and he had no option but to pull down the shutters and start a long, lonely trek home. When this correspondent last spoke to him around 8 pm, Singh was yet to reach home.

EDIT: Thank you so much for the Silver, 'Ally' and 'This' awards kind strangers! Absolutely pumped.

Delivery guys are the real foot soldiers that provide you stuff at your comfort. Where’s the irony? This is an exception not a general behaviour. This doesn't show reality but a twisted message.

mcokvk,,I really don't want to become an engineer,Non-Political," You could always become a disappointment to your parents and choose a position that you are passionate about. See... The roots of this problem extend deeper than most Indians realise. 

A little bit of context about me:
I studied B.Sc.(H) in Mathematics from Delhi University, and finished in 2017 with good overall grades in undergrad (>80%). My subjects were extremely challenging and theoretical in nature (Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, etc.)

The problem:
I tried to enter the Data Science industry right after college, and I'm not even kidding when I say EVERY COMPANY REJECTED ME BECAUSE I WAS NOT AN ENGINEER. Some even said it directly to my face (Fractal, I'm looking at you 😑)

I eventually started pleading for unpaid internships, and got lucky when one kind soul in a Bangalore based start-up decided to give me a chance. Even though I was inside the industry now, most colleagues just assumed that I must've studied math in college because I couldn't get into a good engineering college. Like wtf dude?! Get off your high-horse and learn to look beyond your narrow worldview.

Today, I'm a data scientist with more than 2 years of full-time work ex. But if I could go back and rethink my decision, I'd probably just study engineering.... Because if you're from an Indian middle class family and aspire to earn well, then being a conformative little bitch is so much easier than taking unconventional routes! 

So I ask you this. Should we really blame parents for forcing kids to become engineers? As a society we're the ones who've left them no choice whatsoever. Parents will obviously do what's best for their children. And ""best"" in most cases just means earning enough to lead a respectable lifestyle. My parents were great. They knew I couldn’t handle being an engineer so they didn’t force me into that. 

They forced me into law instead So what do you want to become? Fuck. Is this still a thing? Haven't people learnt from an entire generation of poorly educated and unemployable engineering college graduates from the last 20 years?

We all end working in IT anyways. The reasonable ones end up as developers and the ones like me end up in sales or marketing. I know this might not go down well. But some of us weren't really forced into engineering by our parents. It's just that the places where we come from, the schools we study, the colleges we study in, drills into our heads that engineering/medical is the better option amongst all. Colleges and institutions are equally at fault for this if not more. Every parent doesn't have their horizons broad, so it's the school/college's responsibility too, to teach/encourage kids to take up different professions. I mean I love engineering and am looking forward to learning more about it. But to those who've been forced, I feel for you Oh comeon. If she is a female it's doctor. Males are engineers. As soon as I finished my 10th grade, my dad put me in an integrated engineering degree course which is 6 years long. I wasted four years of my life there because I was too scared to tell him this is not what I  wanted to do and also because he spent all that money here. After finally dropping out with guilt, severe mental issues and just a 10th grade certificate in my hand I started working on my life. 10 years later I'm still at it. I have a decent job, trying to study on the side, and developing hobbies, marriage is out of the question for me although I still get pressure from my family to get it over with but the girls I was interested in don't want anything to do with a confused 30 year old dropout. but I know it could have been much worse. In India parents are placed on a pedestal and we are made to believe they know whats best for us but I would advise anyone in a similar situation to take a stand for what you want in life. As far as I can tell, it's definitely worth it. Do not do it.

I used to love science and engineering. But, engineering college took all my love away, gave me assignments and tons of shit exams.

Now, I hate science and also unemployed. [deleted]"

(Via [@20ncounting](https://twitter.com/20ncounting/status/1268587795536244736?s=21) on Twitter) Considering the economy and demography difference between India and these countries, what would be a more fruitful lockdown strategy that India should have implemented? Sad but we're stuck. Can't really extend the lockdown as we aren't having any peak untill we drop lockdown. Just keep your family safe, that's what matters the most... okay first off I think its way too early to “unlock” anything. I have the privilege of being able to self quarantine for a couple more months and I’m going to do so.

That said, I dont think its fair to just show the number of new cases. We should be discussing the rate of recovery at this point which is inching close to 50% of all cases. Imo lockdown should ended when we are closer to 85 to 95% so that we know that a cure is readily available to us.

At some point I imagine this is going to become like any other disease, you catch it, get treated for a couple days, go back out.

* to be clear when I say rate of recovery I mean the number of people recovered compared with total cases. I’m sure theres a better way of measuring I just dont know what that is yet Keeps me wonder, why was it imposed untimely, why was it revoked untimely and of course what was the achievement and loss Captain Hindsight would love this thread. Hindsight is always 20/20 people. At least scale these results using population. 2.3 lakh cases in a population of 130 crores is different to 2.3 lakh cases in a population of 6-7 crores (Italy, for example). I partially disagree with the blame on the government. I'm not pro-any party. We have to consider the situational awareness of the people which is almost non-existent.

We had more influx of potential cases after the lockdown started. We started moving migrated workers around, we started pulling people from abroad. Everyone is afraid they will not survive the pandemic, but nobody thinks of the effects of a single positive case getting transported to a medium to high population dense area.

We have seen people gather in masses, we have seen people ignore the lockdown rules and do as they want. What surprises me even more is there are people who still think corona is a hoax.

While I agree that the governments should have handled some of the issues better, we are a highly population dense country and it is incredibly hard to counter every single scenario. Without the lockdown we would already be #1 in the global cases chart but a positive is that our mortality rate is much less compared to other countries. Extending the full lockdown any further will impact the economy very badly, but at the same time the measures for partial lockdown should be extreme and responses to threatening situations should be very quick. GDP Per Capita(Nominal, PPP) (2018 Google/World Bank)

India:- $2,009, $6,697

Spain:- $30,370 (15 times), $40,483 (6.04 times)

Italy:- $34,483 (17 times), $42,798 (6.39 times)

Germany:- $47,603 (23.5 times), $54,456 (8.13 times)

U.K.:- $42,943 (21 times), $46,867 (7 times)


Assuming ideal wealth distribution, the citizens of each of the countries you mentioned are far more capable of sustaining a long lockdown.

How do you think a poor country like ours will sustain a lockdown any longer than what it already has?

Source:- Just Googled them.

Edit:-
Added GDP PPP data. Thanks u/scholeszz. People really out here comparing developed nations with India. Go out and you'll see why cases are rising. It might be government's negligence, but most of the blame goes to citizens. No one follows social distancing here. It is government's fault that they didn't tested enough people at the beginning and they weren't ready for this fight at all. They still aren't testing enough but please don't compare India with developed nations. They have much better medical support, more educated citizens and most importantly, less population density. Their staff is well trained unlike ours. How are the other nations doing in terms of the economy? If it's a complete lockdown like ours, I'd like to know the extent and the effect it had on their GDP and local businessess. Cause I've been anti-lockdown (cause of the duration) but if these nations are also managing it the same way, I want to know how they're juggling the rest of the things."

kqyvj5,"So guys here we are. Most of you on this subreddit know how it all started.

In short, I tried to express my opinion against the malpractices of WhiteHatJr, they kept putting down my videos/posts/accounts. And then a lot of things happened and their scam was exposed. Then they filed a 20 crore defamation case over me for exposing them.

Updates since my last post:

* Thank you for all the amazing support you guys showed in my last post telling the news of the case. I asked if I go forward with the case, will you guys support me. And the response was amazing. I am not doing a fundraiser as of now, because the legal cost is not clear now. So let's wait for the hearing. Don't want to end up raising more than what's needed.
* Me and our lawyer, Swathi Sukumar worked really hard on the case. Let's see how it goes tomorrow. Last time they got the Former Attorney General of India, Mukul Rohtagi to represent them. Let's see what happens tomorrow.
* After the case got listed on 23rd Nov, the High Court asked me to take down only 12 tweets and 4 videos which I did. But after that on 6th December my entire Twitter Handle (@ WhiteHatSnr, with 15.2K supporters) was suspended because of 'requests' from WhiteHatJr guys. So is Twitter above our judiciary? Isn't this obstriction to justice? WhiteHatJr had pointed issues in some of my tweets, how will I show those tweets now to show the context of those tweets?
* In the last week of December, even chats from our Telegram group (@ WhiteHatPoonia) were removed for copyright. Who would have thought if that was even possible? Billions of dollars worth of content from Netflix, Prime, Disney etc is being circulated over Telegram, no one can stop that. But WhiteHatJr and Byjus still managed to delete some of our chat.
* Karan Bajaj is still showing up in interviews, telling about their 'successful' company. Today there was news of WhiteHatJr on News18. By tomorrow there might be more paid news coverage.
* I request you guys to write about this issue.

On a different note, if someone is near Delhi, if possible, do visit the farmer's protest. Now I don't know a lot about the new laws, I was too much consumed in my own case. But I really feel that this should not turn violent and govt should listen to these people. On 2nd Jan, I went to Delhi to sign some legal papers and while returning I missed the last bus and found myself right next to the farmer's protest at the Tikri border. Spent the night with these guys, talked to many of them.

News isn't showing their actual points in my opinion.

Again thank you guys for all the support. Reddit is where it all started, keep up the support tomorrow (6th Jan 21). Really counting on you guys. WhiteHatJr crossed all the limits, fake ads, false claims, fake reviews, suppressing dissent, personal abuses, bullying, death threats, and then this 20 crore case. These people don't have any ethics in them. An entire generation was pushed in engineering and now it's the coding 150 crores salary dream.

Tomorrow morning, be there on Twitter, do comments under the Live Law tweets, and express your opinion about this scam. Let's make sure they don't get to influence news again with their marketing campaigns and 'incentives'.

Let's be the change we want to see.

Thank you,

Pradeep Poonia

UPDATE: The hearing is at 10:50 AM (6th Jan 2021)

\----------------

UPDATE (1 PM, 6th Jan) 

The defamation case filed by [**#WhiteHatJr**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=whitehatjr&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6752487782616236032) and [**Karan Bajaj**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABE6qAB7ldySvvRNyKUsnc8ykKy0aCFr30) against me was listed today before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court. I had requested documents from ASCI and from National Consumer Helpline, where complaints against WhiteHatJr were filed.

I had also asked for the records of Wolf Gupta/Ryan Venkat ads from Facebook and Instagram, and the take-down info from Twitter and YouTube. These requests are called ""discovery"" in legal language.

The hearing couldn't go on because of some server issues in the high court, but WhiteHatJr is SO predictable.

They opposed my requests for these documents and don't want these documents to be produced before the Hon'ble Court. They must be scared of what might come out in the open if these documents are given to the court!!

The next hearing is on 1st Feb. I hope you guys will continue your support.

Let's keep up the roar.  
They can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but CAN NOT fool all of the people all of the time. 

Thank you for all the support.

Pradeep Poonia.","Tomorrow morning is the hearing of my case, Karan Bajaj & WhiteHatJr VS. Pradeep Poonia.",Non-Political," PS: I am not sure of the exact timing of the hearing. It will be around 10 am or so. Also sorry I haven't even seen some of the DMs from last time, I am running out of time. If it's not urgent please do a comment instead of a DM. Else I end up missing the urgent DMs.

UPDATE: The hearing is at 10:50 AM (6th Jan 2021) Boss, if you don't win, then India is fucked. There's literally no case here just a bunch of corporate twats being exposed by an honest citizen. Great job on your effort and tomorrow you shall come out with victory!!! We are with you,

Your victory is not your's, it is victory for every common man in India. More power to you. [deleted] We all support you! This deserve a gold but I rather want to pitch that money for the support. I hope it will not come down to that and the truth will prevail. All the best man. Just wanted this out. My friend working as teacher in WhiteHatJr got only half the salary they were promised this month. It happened to multiple people in their group of teachers.
If someone you know is also facing this, then let's spread the word. 1. Line up 12 guardians and few ex employees from Whitfart who felt cheated, let them sign an affidavit and present it to the court as evidence that whitefart is really cheating people and violating labour laws.
2. File a counter defamation and harassment case on Churan Khajaj on a personal basis.

Here is a summary of why farmers are protesting farm bills 

\#copied

Adani, Ambani &other corporates had an eye on massive food grain market of India. They had few problems:

Problem 1 : States had different rules &regulations to buy food grains from farmers. It was difficult for corporates to handle so many states with so many different regulations &taxes

Modi Solution: Took control from states and made one act for whole country. Corporates happy now.

Problem 2: Corporates will buy crops and store them. But Essential Commodity act will stop them for storing crops for long time, as it increase prices in market.

Modi Solution: Food crops will not come under Essential Commodity act and can be stored for longer period. Corporates again happy.

Problem 3 It was hard to determine that what type of crop will be grown by farmers.

Modi Solution: Contract farming for farmers where they will be told by corporates to grow what kind of crop. Corporates again happy.

Problem 4 :

How Corporates will handle court cases if anything goes wrong against farmers.

Modi Solution: Farmers can not go to courts. They will go to SDM and DC. Corporates again happy as they can bribe them easily

They say bills are in favour of farmers. Thank you Pooniaji. I hope and wish you come out victorious. We are all there with you in spirit. Will be commenting in the Twitter live feed too.

My best wishes. Again, we are happy to contribute for legal fees amongst other needed expenses."
lhe481,,India's much abused taxpayers,Policy/Economy," >Assumption: Annual salary between 50 lakh and 1 crore

ho lee sheet The primary reason I want to immigrate away from this country is that I feel thoroughly cheated for having to pay taxes. We get shit infrastructure, no amenities, water cuts, very expensive electricity, no decent public hospitals or schools or basically anything. I HATE paying the taxes I do and then walking on shit, piss and spit filled broken streets or relying on dirty public transport or driving on these pothole-laden, randomly laid roads with no concept of lanes or even consistent bloody width. And we middle class folk get the most screwed as the rich barely pay shit if anything at all and the poor enjoy their satellite TV in their air conditioned slums while we get nothing in return for our taxes. To hell with this place. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/indias-much-abused-taxpayers-you-dont-get-much-benefit-back-salaried-classes-get-the-short-end-of-the-stick/ Atthe end of the end day, this is not even a modi thing, all our governments have been sucking us dry. I still remember Jaitley used to talk about the government indulging in tax terrorism when BJP was not in power.. After coming to power they fixed this problem by reducing the corporate tax for the cronies.. But did not touch the individual income tax slabs.. Serious question here because I don't fully understand why taxes are set to certain rates and the whole economic mathematics behind it.

My dad has to pay 35% as income tax. He's a salaryman. Not super rich but not poor either. Either way, I generally believe it's fine to tax the rich and I think, fine, whatever. His bosses by the way, pay 44%, as they're in a higher bracket. Still, okay fine.


My business owner friends pay ~~close to nothing~~ much less in tax, even income tax they pay is less and they're so much crazy richer than us. Why are business expense write-offs allowed to work like this? Why does every business owner get to pay like no tax? More so in a corrupt country like ours? These people write off egregious personal expenses as business expenses. I know this is the way things have been done for ages, but can someone explain how this is logical? These uncle's come home early, party and shit, go on international vacations and everything. My parents don't get ANY breathing space outside of work, no recreation, nothing. It's not like India has healthy working hours. To get to a position where you're paying 35% you need to give up weekends, overtime, everything because that's india. Business owners retire at 50 and hand it over to their kids. They pay less, chill more, and get to play nepotism with their kids. And I'm fine with the nepotism and the chilling, you deserve it after you made your company and all that. But why do these people get to pay so little in tax?

And I'm not even getting into creative accounting and loophole abuses etc that they do. Like, I had this one classmate whose father had some factory in DD. They'd get cars based out of there to dodge the egregious MH tax on buying cars. You think my parents could do all that? Properties bought with black money, so many bullshit practices. These are the richest and most privileged people.


Like, what's the reasoning behind this? Am I wrong in detesting this? Because everyone's like haan so what Drawing the wrong conclusion from the right data. Only 6 % of Indians pay income tax. (But all pay indirect taxes). Direct taxpayers get zilch for their taxes. Solution? Tax more people? NO! Get real services and value to the taxpayers. It's all corruption, and it has only increased in every sector. Can the middle class ever unite as a voting block, or would we all get outnumbered and slaughtered by illiterate chaddi gang? What is going on with TOI? This is the second decent news from TOI this week. Here is a condensed summary of who contributes how much income tax based on AY 2018-19 data

[https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Pages/Direct-Taxes-Data.aspx](https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Pages/Direct-Taxes-Data.aspx)

60% of the income taxes are contributed by tax payers with income > 1 crore. The funny part is not getting a single benefit out of it after paying hefty taxes."

>Modi should step down. There is no future with him. #FarmersProtest 

Report: https://hrw.org/news/2021/02/02/indian-authorities-lash-out-protests Ohhhh shiiiiittttt , last time I checked , these guys were leaking hush hush documents of US govt. anonymous- *fine I'll do it myself* All things apart, how long have we not heard the phrase ""The PM must step down""? Early days of Modi right? Ok i'll be that guy; This won't make much of a difference. Even if Anonymous succeeds in this goal (which is very unlikely, but if they do it will the most bat-shit crazy thing of the millennium) there will be someone else who will take Modi's place. Amit Shah maybe or maybe even Yogi. My point is while Modi is oppressive he is the chosen oppressor of our country. A large majority of our country voted for him. So in a way we are our own oppressors, Modi is just the face. [deleted] Can any of the Indian media dare to say that modi must step down!! OpIndia: Hacker group anonymous secretly funded by ISI and Mia Khalifa  :0

/s Really want these guys to leak a shit load of information India is very quickly going down the slippery slope of religious fascism which has engulfed my country, Pakistan, since the 1980s. By the looks of it, despite everything, Modi still has majority support - this will take generations to recover from. We have just started to claw back in the past few years or so. Modi is simply any other Indian person but with the will and intellect that rivals none other. If not Modi, somebody else takes his place. Modi is only a projection of the Indian mindset. People get the leaders they deserve.

This is my temporary conclusion."
j2fawo,,"Her tongue was cut, spine broken. What about you?",Politics," This is so messed up man.. Media only considers weed to be of importance... They will talk for hours about what Celebrities ate for breakfast and won't talk about such news... This is so sad and disturbing!! Most of Current Indian media doesn’t have spine According to mainstream media, Celebrity's death is more important than a rape victim's death. Sad! why did UP police hurriedly cremate her in the middle of the night? why was the family locked up in their homes? Just heard that the girl was cremated by police without informing the parents. Imagine the plight. I am a 42 year old and I am simply crying by looking at this. RIP! There is no ""weed"" in this ""story"". Never felt so helpless. It is our mistake. And I am sure  within few days we will forget when we will watch sensationalized news of another celeb who consume drugs because our governments good at diverting our attention because they know in India cows, celeb , religion & mindless shouting debates comes much above thanlives of human being .RIP girl we failed you . I started to think I was getting numb to this. Guess I was wrong. This one fucked me up again. 

And nothing will change. This is beyond disgusting! What was the need to do this? Why did they have to pour gasoline on a raging fire? This is insanity!

Yogi needs to resign. Rape has become so normalised that the word itself isn't enough to grab any attention, we need gruesome and graphic depictions to evoke emotion and outrage."
k4otsa,,Congrats to the CEO tho,Business/Finance," I lost my sanity when i found out that Bata was Swiss but Peter England, Allen Solly and Louis Philip were Indian.* edited This is me when I was a teenager finding out Maggi is Swiss My childhood was a lie And it's not actually pronounced Ba-taa like we do. The company was founded by a Czech person called Tomáš Baťa hence the name Bata. And his surname is pronounced Ba-cha. Like baccha as in kid in hindi 😂😂 I remember reading an AskReddit thread long ago where someone from Brazil mentioned the same thing. Then they got a bunch of replies from people from India, Pakistan, South Africa, Thailand and some European countries who all thought it was a local brand. Was pretty hilarious. During school they showed us a video of World war 2 Germany, and hitler was on a car that was driving through Berlin and in the background was... BATA. 9th grade me was shooketh Bata was not a Swiss company for 126 years. It was founded in Zlín in Austria-Hungary. Zlín is in the Czech Republic now. Bata moved to Lausanne in Switzerland only in 2004. Therefore, Bata has been a Swiss company for merely 16 years. Well. Makes me feel posh knowing that my school shoes were Swiss Massive imprint in India though. In fact I think there's a town called ""Batanagar"" where they have factories. Maybe cause Bata sounds so much like Tata and Batata My dumb-ass used to think Bata was owned by Tata."

https://imgur.com/eaycEFM I would take a chance with this actor. He has done this in the past(speaking his mind out). He once did and then got destroyed by the biggies of the Telugu Film Industry for maligning their image. Finally someone understands the meaning of propaganda. That's what i said in one of comments on some other post 😂

Its like they made a whatsapp group or something to tweet the same f_ing tweet with same f_ing picture and same f_ing hastag on same f_ing time. Real rang de basanti! Not the fake swamis wearing the colour. ""Iss desh me wahi imaandar or saccha h jise paise nhi mila""
Translation-""in india , one who hasnt got money is honest and real"" [This](https://mobile.twitter.com/actor_siddharth?prefetchtimestamp=1612448392912) is the tweet. 

And he is not ""Sidharth Malhotra"" of SOTY.

If I am not wrong he is quite big in Telugu and Tamil films and made his mark in Bollywood with Rang De Basanti(fan of him since then)

I really like the way he articulates his thoughts, very easy to understand and to the point. Also I want other people to share the tweets/opinions of well known celebrities of south. We should know them and appreciate their effort because except for the same 4-5 people in Bollywood there is nothing left to expect from them. 👏👏 ,never thought I'd see  Kumble in that list ..😞 I just quickly visited profile of some of the cricketers I like as a human being as well for the on and off ground behavior. Rahul Dravid doesn't have Social media presence, He does have a very old FB page with last post in 2019 His Shadow, Cheteswar Puajra Didn't tweeted anything yet.  Sad to see Ajnikya Rahane singing the same tune as his Captain. He is still the guy from Rang De Basanti. My man just put his career on the line. Respect!"

iyxyfo,,This seemed better in my head,r/indiameme," Idk but whose mom checks sugar content im coca cola.. Indian moms: “Pizza has a lot of fat in it”

Also Indian moms: “you’ve only eaten 7 bhature, here, have 3 more” Happy tuntun mausi sounds And the moms who think bournvita is healthy We Indians eat soo much sugar it is infuriating and it soo normalised. While I agree on homemade food being good, there is something called portion control which is not usually seen in Indian homes. Why stop at one laddoo, have two more. Why have one paratha, have another.

All of this compounds up slowly and steadily to make us fat. You don't get fat overnight. Decision to not exercise and not executing portion control will make you fat. And believe me, Not a single diet will help you, be it Intermittent Fasting, Keto if you cannot control your portions and overeat. Indian boys ordering diet coke while eating 2 kgs butter chicken. What about rice? Not only that, products like Bournvita and Milo are also filled with sugar, but mom's make kids drink that everyday. Not their fault exactly, more to do with products marketing Laddoos have protein from daal, dairy/ghee too along with vitamins and minerals. Often have nuts as well.

No artificial chemicals usually. Edit: when purchased from reliable sources or made at home! Ngl ladoos are tasty as fuck"

Those who can donate should do it to keep Khan Academy and the likes running. Udemy isn't free. But it serves your purpose if you know what you're looking for. I cringe every time i see a whitehatjr advertisement (which is a lot they are literally everywhere) I booked a free trial to see if it was genuine (I know a bit or two about coding so..) AND it's so bad, the teacher does everything and like, he doesn't even explain it and lastly your parents get a message that your son/daughter made this. Its absolutely useless.   


{Oh, and lastly, they give false hopes like in their ad where investors were fighting for employing Chintu \[LMAO\]  while there are so many Comp.Sci students who probably learnt like a dozen coding languages but are still looking for a job} My dad was like why don't you try byju for studying.. and I was like I mean I can but why would I want to

I don't know why we expect our citizens to elect intelligent leaders. 

If the average intelligence of country is low, the politicians they elect would be low intelligence too.

They are literally a representation of our people. Isn't this governments fault more than people. If govt had banned kumbh and  the prayers. I don't think any Indian would have attended these events.
 
If govt is allowing, it implicitly means every thing is ok. God could never stop this pandemic. Prayers couldn’t stop deaths. It killed religious people too yet I don’t know why are people still believing in God. Why are people still risking their lives and attending religious events and prayers that exposes them to crowds. Saudi Arabia closed mosques for a while and enforces social distancing and capacity limits on the ones that are open.

Broadcast starts from 7:00 PM IST only on Star Sports and Star Sports HD.*

*#VivoIPL #CSKvsMI* 

/s more money should be spent on healthcare but how is IPL expenditure related to that? How is the government spending on IPL? Isn't IPL just another business? Aren't there people working for the IPL? If they suddenly stopped the IPL because of the virus imagine the 1000s of people who become jobless. Honestly I understand the spirit in which this comment was made, but it seems very uneducated. It is however important that the govt and the IPL makes sure that these matches don't become a site for virus spread. The BCCI pays for it. The BCCI is an independent body.
Besides, the govt. earns tax money from ipl but y'all see a firang say some shit and lose all brain cells and believe anything they say. Appreciate the concern, but he is simply misinformed. BCCI is a private body in theoretical definition, and contribute hugely by revenue through broadcasters during IPL. 

Same thing has happened in Europe with Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, and UEFA Champions League. UK had a bad second wave and Premier League matches still went on simply because they bring in a huge broadcast revenue.

Heck, these leagues continued despite players from teams testing positive. Reason - Money.

BCCI is no pure-hearted saint either, and just like all entities elsewhere, they will try their level best to host matches. Every private employer wants their business to keep churning profits. It's just that sports is a field where WFH is not possible, so we have bio-bubbles instead. Everyone here blaming IPL. Please tell me how banning IPL will solve our problems. Will these private companies like Dream11, Star etc spend ad money on people if IPL is cancelled? No they won't. Will the viewers donate money spent on hotstar? No they won't. Most of us will just watch some movies/tv show. Blaming IPL is pointless and it's an easy target. [deleted]"
jvw5pd,,"After constantly being told off in Bombay because I didn't have the right connections/contacts, I finally said ""Screw Bollywood."" and made a short action video on my own because I don't plan on giving up. Would love to know what you guys think about it!",Art/Photo (OC)," Terrific effort mate. I think the fight scene choreography is the only place I can find any fault, and that says a lot.

Great camera work (loved the missing the seatbelt latch - gave a Deadpool sort of vibe), actual solid acting, good story, and a distinctive gritty / comic style throughout which even if maybe overdone these days is very well executed. In film school I have no doubt this effort would earn you an A. 

I think you have a tremendously bright future, and wonder if you shouldn’t consider a Kickstarter style effort to fund a longer film that you could submit to film contests.

Edit: I really can’t get over the quality of this. You see these posts and it is almost unfailingly a complete childish / amateur effort that’s worthy of derision.  This is a really nice change of pace. Nice , Part 2 with a ferrari 488 Pista or Mclaren 720s That camera work on the gearshift was sick, never seen that before. All in all, solid work, mate! Wow that was so good!

Things I liked:

1. Top notch Cinematography. Especially those scenes where he changes gears. Some cool quick back and forth transitions.
2. The protagonist just oozes this eerie/uncanny vibe, I love it. Love how the character is left vague enough for the viewers to wonder if it really is a human or some cyborg or supernatural entity behind the helmet. That bullet scene just accentuated an already badass character.
3. Music. I know it's hard for someone new to manage everything but I really like how you have used the music in this one.
4. I was also pleasantly surprised by how good the fight choreography was. 

Things I disliked:

None.

10/10.

Also, YouTube is your friend. Considering the quality of your product, you'll click soon enough. I remember a channel called Crypt TV that started as a small horror themed channel that uploaded short scary videos with surprisingly good production value. And soon enough they exploded. Now several horror films promote themselves on that channel. I hope you find similar success on YouTube or any other platform you decide to move ahead with. If you already have a YouTube channel, let me know. I would love to have your videos on my YT timeline rather than those cringy filth YouTube recommends. Ryan Gosling with a hammer has entered the chat. The shooting scene and fight scene were a bit unrealistic but it's far better compared to the mainstream stuff.

Really liked the visuals, the bgm build was good too. You have ways to go dude. I loved the whole video but I still feel iffy about the guy wearing the helmet inside the car.. I know it’s a creative choice but looks jarring to me. Except that, everything was top notch. The cinematography, lighting, and the stylistic choices... Good start. Really well made, but the part where he gets shot and takes a while for him to understand what happened. I feel like if he came with a gun, he would be more aware Guys please upvote along with commenting to increase the reach. OP, all the best! 😇 Pretty Good. Got a little bit of John Wick Vibes. But I would like to point out 2 things, just nitpicking. If you shoot someone on helmet(he's gonna die), but for bulletproof jacket, the impact is gonna move the person a little bit lol. Also gun shots gives echo in parking lot. Nonetheless, I liked the overall short film, it's something different. I will give you 4/5😋."

You still don't understand that there's nothing wrong with IPL? No common people are allowed in the stadium. Just watch one match. IPL involves a lot of money, so they would never let it be ruined because of Covid.

Everything else is true. Not right to include IPL in this. Not only they are not allowing spectators in the stadium, but they are also providing entertainment during these difficult times. My parents have decided to attend a marriage in Punjab even after we are hearing news od someone we know struggling to get a bed or dying due Covid-19.

-my andhbhakt friend Country is in the middle of the second wave of a raging pandemic. Instead of acting like the prime minister and leading the country in these trying times he is acting like a party worker and campaigning for his party. Says a lot about Modi and Shah's priorities. Run the country or benefit the party. Has he even done any of his duties as the prime minister these past few weeks? No. Has he only acted for the benefit of his party. Yes. 

Modi isn't a leader. Just an opportunist who can manipulate people. AAP is very high on trolling if you are ever  bored just visit their instagram page 🤣🤣 someone get this guy a barber. He is a poster boy not a prime minister. Here in Kerala he is desperate to make seats for BJP. Racism and xenophobia coming to a nationalist leader near you.  Modi is a disgrace.

Other wild ideas come to mind like having Angelia Jolie painted brown to play the role of Aishwariya Rai. Outrageous blasphemy, I tell you. Bhumi Pednekar's black face was outrageous. I couldn't even sit through that joke of a movie. These people claim to be liberals and whatnot but deep inside they are akhand chutiyas. This skin colour problem goes very deep in our system and will be very difficult to get rid of. I am still very proud that Irrfan Khan and Nawaz Siddiqui could make it big in this industry, given that this country wants chocolate boy looks for each and every lead role. We can only hope that our disgusting social system improves in the future. Hrithik doesn't even have good make up on.

Police in UP has no sense of ethics or basic human etiquettes. How do we expect such police to be with the public. These are just politicians work force. UP/Delhi police do molest/torture females to bring down the morale of the group. I now have a new-found respect for the Gandhis. That police officer would not be near her if she wasn't protecting that party worker. It's hard to believe that any leader would actually do that. You know what, this is all state sponsored...

No one in right conscious will do such thing to a national leader but This UP Police is backed by their Government... And I have zero doubt that Adityanath himself would've directed, instructed to do all manhandling without remorse, thought...

Hate for Gandhi's flows in Blood stream of these Sanghi and BJP people...yesterday's twitter trends only prove how much they hate name Gandhi! It so pains to see images like these. Similar images came out during CAA protests as well.
Police are no better than criminals. In the eyes of many men, when pushed and challenged, a woman, even a powerful one,  is just another woman to put in her place (physically). This is our culture. I learned the hard way that you never know if a man really respects you until you challenge them. Unfortunately, even they themselves don’t know how they think, as most women have learned for their safety to not stand up to them and many men cruise through life being coddled by the women around them.

Sunny paaji had a  blistering ""tareekh pe tareekh"" rant in the film Damini. If he had done  it in real life, he would have been charged with contempt of court.

I can only sympathise with [u/pooniahigh](https://www.reddit.com/u/pooniahigh/)  who tried to bring attention to the malpractices of the edutech  industry and got served legal notices for pointing out blatant  violations which were not even rebutted or denied. As they say - ""No  good deed goes unpunished !"". We can only do our bit for the cause by  sharing videos of Byju's and WHJ on Whatsapp groups. If even a couple of  families from our circle of friends and relatives pay heed to our  forwards and refrain from enrolling their kids in these dubious  programs, that would be a small victory against them. We are ready to help, in case of capital shortage Slapping a billion defamation cases on you until you run out of money or energy to fight back.

Nevertheless the courage and tenacity you displayed is commendable https://mobile.twitter.com/pooniaV3 Do you have a gofundme or any other funding app. I would definitely like to comtribute to your cause. Godspeed man, wish you all the best. Is there any way of us helping out other than sharing these stuff? How can we support this person??"
leghgn,,India's population split into half,Politics," How does an agrarian economy move to a industrial economy? Just asking out of curiosity. Most fertile deltas, suitable terrain, availability of water, illiteracy, history.. Any sensible country would have divided UP in to 4 states Peacefully living in the yellow region If 2026 delimitation goes as planned 50% of MP'S will come from here. 

This country is done for if that happens Is this division on the basis of what is the smallest single continuous area in which exactly half of the indian population resides? Thats quite scary Take my free award Ganges plain has always been so fertile, interesting map btw. Guys y'all need to stop with the gangetic plain/cow belt bashing. It's really uncalled for. This was to show how fertile the region is. You have to take geography into account as well and that the main intention of my post on here was to show that its just a very fertile farming area and hence the heavy population. deccan plateau in south-central india, thar/kutch in western rajasthan and gujarat and heavy dense forests in parts of central india and northeast india, himalayas to the far north cant support such heavy populations. I understand they have high population/fertility but they've always had higher population compared to rest of the region. Wow, I thought tamil nadu was already too overpopulated"

this is not the first time they have shown guts to do this. kashmiri women goes through this almost everyday on [social media](https://imgur.com/a/DE5RnQ8) this is [another](https://imgur.com/a/LVLjiVH) one. the best reply to a well built argument to a women is ""randi(whore)"". after every rape in the country, the victim's name is on [trending](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/how-perverted-is-india-kathua-victims-name-becomes-top-trending-search-on-porn-w/311055) on a porn site. and [this](https://imgur.com/a/v4XbjlF) is how they feel proud sharing the pride they will feel if they would have r@ped the victim. in this case an 8 year old who was r@ped in kathua. and [this](https://theprint.in/talk-point/sp-sinha-kashmir-rape-comment-is-it-time-for-strict-code-of-conduct-for-military-veterans/322663/) is how huge influencers like retired general of army SP Sinha were also joining these scums and in a way encouraging them to show off their r@pist mentality.

1. Media regulations so that they do not conduct their own ""court"" and give out decisions that they want and demanded by a political party.

2. Demand resignation of Finance minster because she has totally messed up the economy right now. Not having any idea of the actual realities and just focusing on favouring the  corporates, which is not bad but is definitely not the only thing to do. Kyu toda ghar uska ?

Sounds like an economic issue from what I'm reading so far. Many people like this sadly.. Only a few Hindi speaking and based news channels are running the Rhea, Kangna stories, whole of India isn't watching that.
Check what the Marathi, Rajasthani, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Malayam, Bengali, Odia news channels are showing. Most Indians are watching that. More than anyone could ever think of. The most watched channel in the country is a Tamil channel Sun Tv, not an English/Hindi one. We had 95,000 COVID-19 cases and more than a thousand deaths yesterday. 

Our fixation on the death of a single celebrity and the utter disregard for the deaths of tens of thousands of people just goes to show how little the life of an ordinary person matters in India. The media is going to report more on things that the viewers deem to be important. This is, in essence, the spirit of Democracy. Let the people choose what they want to see. 

So the problem isn't the Indian media. The problem is the Indian people. Thank god my TV was disconnected since began of Pandemic. First it was numbers, then come  SSR, Kangana and chutiypa. Indian news channel has hit new low. The Rajya Sabha TV is far better. I think so"

gwa3mm,,"Hasan Minhaj calls out Indian racism and obsession with fair skin | Patriot Act ""We Cannot Stay Silent About George Floyd"" (Timestamp: 5m29s)",Politics," Another point worth mentioning is the background gundey in Bollywood movies. The dark-skinned bad guys idea is so normalised in Indian culture, that every time as a kid I would go to this place called Little India in Singapore, where most people look quite dark, I would genuinely be afraid of kidnaping. That fucking impacts how we perceive stuff later on. People need to boycott shit like this. An absolutely brilliant segment from Hasan, the most passionate I've ever seen him.

Anybody whose rode on the blue line in Delhi knows how many African students live around the Dwarka Mor & Nawada area and how they are ostracized from society. Stupid ass people call them 'Nigerian Drug dealers'. I once saw an African guy with an Indian girl (maybe not even a romantic couple) and some stupid ass uncle went off on the girl for being with a 'kallu'.

And by the way, this is not an India only problem. Asian countries are some of the least tolerable countries in the world. One of my friends was treated so shitty in Singapore that he became depressed and had to come back to India.

Fucking melanin in skin is still one of the biggest problems in 2020. Fml I wasn't told I was dark and black and called kallu by white people, I was called that by my fellow North Indian friends, because I am from the South. Dude's really shouting out facts.
Bollywood celebrities to be sent to britain asap. I think this is ingrained in our culture, all I remember as a kid was seeing the Rakshas protrayed as being dark skinned folks with big teeeth and moustaches and all the Devatas were fair AF with shaved faces.

I mean even Lord Krishna was supposed to be dark but our Artisans had to portray him with a blue shade like ... a Avatar...(hehehe) The way he exposed the fake and hypocritical nature of the Bollywood celebs promoting skin lightening creams hits the nail on the head. I would have been happy if he called out Priyanka Chopra and Sonam Kapoor by name for promoting racism via Fairness products. This can stop only if there is some financial damage for these fake liberals. Bollywood stars and cOoL Indian kids trying to score social justice brownie point on social media with BLM posts and conveniently staying silent while discrimination against north-easterns or people with similar look and dark skinned continues.

You think it is funny being asked for Chinese domicile? No right? Bloody hypocrite fools of highest order.

And then their is unwarranted casteism even at most random places. Clerk slow at handing tickets in railway station due to shitty system? ""Reservation wala hoga sala"". Arre brahmin ho ke kya ukhaad lia tumne?? I am a South Indian and I am kinda fair , so many people (especially those who aren't from South India) have asked  me if I am really a South Indian cuz I don't look like one. Indians have forever been acting like they are superiorly clever and know how to get the best out of the US, all the while dismissing Blacks and Latinos as inferior. This is a great wake up call to desis, you guys would be groveling in the mud if not for the emigration act of 1965 which was fought for and won by the blood and tears of civil rights activists.

Relying on indirect taxes is one of the worst moves ever. They are extremely regressive compared to progressive direct taxation.

Imagine a poor guy in India paying 260% tax on oil. 

Cut indirect taxes and broaden the direct tax base. This is the way to go. Instead, Modi has been hiking indirect taxes and cutting the direct tax base. The fool that he is. This would’ve been good if the infrastructure was in place for alternatives (EV, green energy etc) Blind and brute taxing of citizens is no different than a company exploiting its monopoly and charging the shit out of helpless people

It could be fine for short term where transport (I know oil is not just for transport) is desired to be limited due to the pandemic but when lockdowns are safe to be lifted, will there be decrease in prices to aid the recovering economy? Bhakts will come back with... Siachen mein hamare jawan.. As Indians we forget things very easily.

See you all ranting when it reaches 150. 

Till then enjoy How else will Nerondra build his palace Unlike the other countries mentioned in this list, india is still a developing economy. The growth engine of the country is very much tied to increased economic activity. And increased economic activity is very much tied to how accessible fuel us.

Imagine a trader who supplies products to retailers or even direct to home, whether he uses a scooter or a cycle to transport his wares has a big impact on his reach and market. If he cannot afford to use a scooter because fuel is too costly then his economic activity is totally hampered. 

And this will have an impact on the countries economy also. 

So there has to be a debate on how justifiable it is to tax an essential commodity to this extent !! RemindMe! 3 years I've been screaming about this on reddit for quite a while, not enough people seem to care. I work in a petroleum industry, and so I am annoyed by this reality almost everyday 60% population is out of tax net as agriculture income is not taxed.

Only the salaried class cannot pay direct taxes for 125 crore population. 

These high levels of indirect taxes will only increase income inequality and eventual anarchy.

All other sources of direct taxes like property taxes etc are not sourced.

The BJP will not touch its core base of salaried class and cannot increase income tax.

GST has further messed up the indirect tax collection and neither widened the tax net due to the complicated slabs.

There is no hope for the macroeconomic health of this nation in the next 2-3 years. Isn't this just ridiculous? there is a deep-rooted decay if we are not able to correct this."

jlvey1,,"1 vs 3000: I couldn't afford a Telescope or a Tracker, so I spent 3 nights taking over 3000 Exposures of The Andromeda Galaxy using just an entry-level camera. Merged them together using a technique called ""Stacking"", and this is the result. Taken from Bhopal [Nikon D3100, 2909x1406] [OC]",Photography," #Details:
**Left** is a Single exposure straight out of the camera on how the sky(and particularly the galaxy) looked. **Right** is what I got after stacking 3000+ frames of the Galaxy.

Andromeda Galaxy is about 2.5 Million Light Years away from us. Normally, you'd photograph a subject like this using a motorized tracking mount or at least going to a darker area. I couldn't afford either of those things(the latter due to the current pandemic) so I just took all these shots from my roof instead. I know that some other shots you may have seen of M31 are probably _way_ better than this, but the fact that I could even get Andromeda even from a Bortle Class 6 sky was enough for me. 

**If you like this shot, you can check out my other work on my insta @astronot_yet . I do Astrophotography with a cheap/affordable camera and try to demonstrate that beautiful night sky shots are possible even without driving hundreds of miles to a forest or to spend your entire month's salary on buying expensive gear.** 

#TIP:
If you don't like to read huge wall of texts, I would recommend watching 'Nebula Photos' on YouTube instead. He has a series on [Andromeda without a tracker](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrzbdmripj1fZJ-8BWm5CMU_Moj4lBnnk) and it's absolutely the most comprehensive and detailed guide I have ever seen.

#What is Stacking?  
Stacking means taking lots of images of the same subject, align them together and take an average of all the frames. This increases the Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR) of the image and reduces the random noise that creeps up in your photos. Bottom line: You can get really high details by stacking multiple images than using just one image. 
 
#Equipment-

Nikon D3100, Nikkor 70-300mm telephoto lens, a cheap tripod, a wired remote shutter(optional)

#EXIF: 
155mm, F/4.5, ISO 12800, 2sx3084 exposures


#Process:
1) Getting the focus right is the single biggest challenge while shooting dim objects like these, so I spent a considerable time fine tuning the focus to get it as sharp as possible.

2) Next, we need to locate the Andromeda Galaxy. The best way is to download any star chart app, and use the Augmented Reality feature that most of them have these days. I used [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simulationcurriculum.skysafari5&amp;hl=en_IN) but you can use your own favorite.

3) Point your camera roughly between the constellation Cassiopeia and the star Mirach. M31 should be just a little below Mirach.

4) A remote shutter or intervaloemter is advised to avoid touching the camera again and again and minimize blurriness/disturbance. You can buy a cheap wired remote, or if your camera is fairly new it may already have an intervaloemeter built in. If neither of these are possible, just put your camera in a 2s delay timer and you'll essentially achieve the same result.

5) How to select your exposure length: If you set your camera's shutter duration for let's say 15-20s or something, what you will see are [star trails](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/ua/PegasusTrails.jpg) where instead of pin pointed stars, you'd see them moving in a line, ruining our shot. In order to get sharp looking stars, we use the [rule of 500](https://petapixel.com/2015/01/06/avoid-star-trails-following-500-rule/) which is essentially 
>Shutter duration = 500/(Focal length x your camera's crop factor)

Take a shot, zoom in and check the stars, if you see some trailing, lower your shutter length and test again. For my case, Nikon cameras have a crop factor of 1.5, so at the focal length of 155mm, Rule of 500 gave me 500/(155x1.5)= ~2s.

6) Take as many exposures as you can. If you're already in a darker area, 1000 exposures would be good enough. DO NOT change any settings in between the exposures. It's a good idea to not disturb the camera at all while it's taking the shots.

7) Take a few bias, dark and flat frames. These are called ""Calibration Frames"" and their job is to remove any noise that is being generated by the Camera itself(Heat, dust on the sensor, etc). [How to take these here](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/faq.htm#lightdarkflatoffset)

8) After all this, you can use any stacking software to process these shots. My favorite is Deep Sky Stacker and Sequator. Pixinsight is also a capable one, but it's not free so pick whichever one you like. The main job of stacking software is to align all the exposures and then sort of take an average of the frames which decreases noise and increases the Signal to Noise ratio of our image, so the final shot results in extremely high details and very less noise.

9) I processed the result in Pixinsight, and retouched it a bit in Lightroom.


Please note that this is a very simple explanation, and some of the rules and technologies I wrote above might have mistakes, or may not work in your case. Please remember, experiment and experience will give you the best results. Also, if I indeed made some mistakes above, please correct me.

Ask me if you guys have any other questions :) Looking at *2.5 million years* past galaxy is just scary. You never know what really has happened in those *2.5 million years* out there. Dude this is awesome. Kudos for getting the shot or should I say shots and posting a detailed explanation of how to do it.

Come to Tamil Nadu. We call everyone ji! and not even with their name followed with a ji, just ji. lol similarly, Behan is Sister and Behanji is Mayawati This needs to be pinned lmao. A guy I know said 'Veer Godse' with full sincerity Is it just me or is this a sanghi free space😂. Because I went into the comments to find some sanghi saying ""How dare you disrespect hamare godse ji"" Well observed.

 I dont know why but  when I hear people say Modiji , I just get the same feeling of being ass holes. lmao Modi ji Ite also means you're in line for a parliamentary seat on a ticket of the ruling party, with an important parliamentary committee posting waiting for you in your first term. Ministerial/ chief ministerial berth is also a possibility if you complement that with actively following his ideals."

^^^^^/s [deleted] hammare sikh bhaiyon ne desh ke liye kya kya nhi kiya orr badle mein government sirf ek bill nhi change kar sakhti  #shameonyoubjp I was confused for 30 seconds as to what this cartoon is trying to convey until I realized that the spelling of jitna is wrong These protests are just as big, if not bigger, as the 2011 anti corruption movement. The difference is in how the media is selling it, they are discrediting the whole movement by saying that the farmers are misled and accusing them of being khalistani sympathisers. BJP wouldn't be in power today if UPA had used similar tactics back in 2011.

BJP have been toying with the idea of 'one nation one election' and soon it will be a reality, hope you all enjoyed freedom while it lasted because we are soon going back to the days of servitude. Original credit: Sampat Saral, a well known satirist in hindi literature and kavya sammelans. We can appreciate the value of food without unnecessarily bitching about technology. Those two things have nothing to do with each other. This is the common logical fallacy of thinking in false dichotomies. There’s no reason we can’t have technology and farming together.

At some point in time the media has to draw a line and say we’re going to stop representing farmers as uneducated, technology hating luddites and instead show them as the modern voice of India as they’re growing to be. Are you challenging us devs? This is what my father said a decade back. Now he ends up doing everything from digital payments to whatapp on his android phone. Sampat saral quote"
mycbh8,,Choose your govt. wisely,Politics," Very powerful image OP. Sadly I’ve lost faith the people of India will do better the next time. In a democracy, the government wants to silence those questioning it. If that is not authoritarianism, I sincerely don’t know what is. And still people will vote with their insecurities and lies spoken to them...India WAKE UP fun fact. it is pretty hard to find an oxymeter in the market. unless you are ready to pay 2500-3000 here in gurgaon. this government has basically failed to even control blackmarketing of basic medical hardware. let alone ensure proper supply. not hard to see why there is so much shortage of beds and oxygen. Middle Finger is what BJP Members deserve. Just a reminder!

There's gonna b elections in 7 States in 2022. 6 of them governed by the BJP.
Of the 6 - UP & Guj (one of the worst affected by 2nd wave but numbers fudged); Uttarakhand has the ""jeans misogynist"" CM; Goa had one of the worst environmental decisions!

ldt3n0,,Our voices have reached to Rajya Sabha. WhiteHatJr vs Pradeep Poonia defamation lawsuit update.,Business/Finance," WhiteHatJr mazak samjh rakha tha na logo ko, parents ki hard earned savings ko, chote bacho ke dreams ko? 
Guys let's keep moving forward. Together we can make a big change. What eludes me is that this got no attention whatsoever in media. I remember taking part in one of those Byju x ToI aptitude competitions. Secured a decent rank.
By that time I was pretty sure that I want to take up commerce in eleventh and my parents were fine with my decisions.
Right after this competition, these Byju A-holes started ringing my mom's phone like crazy. They just wanted to sell their products and kept on saying stuff like ""aapka bacha toh acha hai padhai mei usse science karwao"" ""commerce, humanities toh woh bache lete hai jo padhai mei bekaar hote hai"". 
Luckily my parents and I saw through their lies and didn't end up in this rabbit hole. This is a high time to stand up against these absurd apps. WhiteHat Jr basically makes a child travel on to the path of coding, it's like forcefully making children opt coding without them discovering the other job options available. This idea is so stupid, damn! Congrats Mr Poonia. Your efforts paid off and I hope the government proposes a plan to ban such ads. First time I'm hearing the education minister not speak nonsense. Yesterday night Bengali News had an 1 hr show where they brought a supposed 12 yr Super Coder who made a lot of play store games. To show his geniusness he was asked a few questions. I thought that whole show was scripted as he was asked super easy definition type questions. The show was presented by Byju You snipped the hydra before it grew two more heads..

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/india) if you have any questions or concerns.* Guys I'm very very saddened and traumatised of events going on, love from Chile. Can't help much but my thoughts are with you Our PM is an epic gamer. Have you seen his k/d ratio? Main article: https://time.com/5964796/india-covid-19-failure/ Insightful article. Key talking points

* And only a third of India’s health care spending comes from the government, with the rest mostly coming out of citizens’ pockets. **“It essentially means that those who can afford to purchase health can have it”**
* “It’s equal parts complacency and incompetence.” **Many Indians who took strict precautions last year abandoned their masks and gathered indoors** when the broader public messaging implied that India had conquered the virus. They were “pristine prey,” as Mukherjee puts it, when the virus resurged this spring. 
* **India’s economy** was one of the hardest-hit in the pandemic, and lockdown was eased in June to allow businesses to reopen.

Shedding light at the end of tunnel? 

* India may be far less wealthy than the Western countries now lending support, but it also has the tools to emerge from this crisis. It has a history of successful, large-scale immunization programs for diseases like polio and tetanus, first-rate scientists, highly trained doctors and powerful networks of community health workers. This is such a massive crisis on so many different levels and the worst part is that it could all be avoided. What makes this unfathomable in the fact that our government isn't a Covid denier either, unlike some other countries such as Brazil where Covid wreaked havoc. Our government realizes the threat of the virus and even went into a full blown lockdown because of it! We went into a lockdown to avoid this exact situation! That lockdown took a massive financial toll on the economy and not to mention the underprivileged people who lost their lives trying to go back to their homes. All those struggles have been wiped clean because of the government's safety precautions, or lack thereof. 

The government had 8-10 months to ramp up the healthcare infrastructure and I'm not talking about fancy hospitals but basic healthcare like oxygen supply, medicines and ventilators.

It's not the virus that's killing people but the government's incompetence that is killing people. Someone who is diagnosed with Covid pneumonia has a fairly high chance of recuperating if they are given the required oxygen supply and other body drips such as anti-blood clot injections and Remdesivir to prepare the body to fight the virus but this is not the case. 

This is not death by natural causes, this is death by murder. The most pathetic aspect of this whole thing is: the entire Bhakt eco-system, intead of calling a spade a spade is now working towards blaming everyone else. Right now, the top posts in the Indian bhakt/INCEL groups are:

1.) Farmers protests brought the UK variant to Delhi because of some NRI-Khalistan nexus

2.) There is no evidence that suggests that Modi's political rallies caused a significant increase in infections

3.) There is an international conspiracy to defame India (Modi) by showing the country in a bad light

4.) *One* temple somewhere is giving away free-food.

&#x200B;

All bases covered by the Sanghi crowd. Divert/avoid blame, feed anti-India conspiracy theories, promote religion. Religion is a bigger disease in this country than Corona. Abki Baar, antim sanskaar! Time iS aNtI nAtioNal Now just like they got the Indian High Commission to call out that completely true [Australian News Article](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-crisis-govt-issues-rejoinder-to-australian-paper-for-scathing-article/article34420451.ece) as fake, and the shitshow that was the [BBC Interview](https://youtu.be/Hrr0rZLHqv0), what will they do to deny this now?

They will be enrolled as WhiteHat Jr. scholars and will be earning crores before they are 15 , like Wolf Sharma./s Ah shit, those were dark days. We had a new house under construction so we lived in a flat. I had to share my room with my sister and grandmother. I had 0 privacy to study. I was depressed, had math tuition at 4 to 6 in the morning, regular class from 7 to 2. Coaching from 3 to 7. I didn't clear jee  had a terrible percentage for 12th. But got decent rank in state. Got to a well established private college which is utter crap in reality but it's the best one around. I'm in class 11 and was forced to study class 11 + JEE integrated. I had no interest in that and the result, I didn't listen to the classes, even more worse because they are online.

The result.... My classmates are way ahead and are studying a lot. Meanwhile I just started studying and I have to cover 2 textbooks for each chapter. We have s very toxic relation with studies. Let kids be kids ffs. IIT wasn't bad enough but now there's shit like whitehatjr popping up which is another very regressive step This is legit. I did give FIITJEE exam in class 9 for IIT preparation. My dad when my uncle said ""iski IIT coaching lagwalo"" :
""Vo khud dekh lega Tu apna dhyaan rakh"". Thanks Dad. Severely inaccurate. Bottom right has a calculator. Unacceptable. Did you even go to coaching for this when you were 3 years old? You will not get into IIT with this kind of negligence. Shame on you. I remember waking up at 4 am with a slap on the day of the exam. What?! The coaching starts from 8th grade now?!! 
Humare zamane mein (20 saal pehle) 11th se shuru hoti thi. Nobody bothered about it before that.
Sounds like such a torture. Poor kids. I remember one time I visited India and we met with this kid who was my age and as soon as he got back from school he instantly went to tuition for like 4 hours. It sounds like hell. this mfs already too late, my sperms already enrolled with Allens classes"

Because if the data is correct, you can also corelate the population density with arable land and how long the area has been inhabitated for.

1) They can't accept farmers to be educated and intelligent
2) The can't accept farmers to be fluent in foreign languages (only highlighting their own insecurities about their local languages)
3) They can't accept a farmer to be well off and afford western fashion practices
4) They can't accept farmers to live an urban lifestyle and enjoy items like pizza
5) They think people protesting for their rights don't desevre to be comfortable. and I already started getting messages from pro-hindutva guys in groups with these images suggesting that its not protest, its fun filled holidays, free luxury, great food and what not.

mk1nys,,The Indian education system is far behind!,Non-Political," Which college ? And your professional Degree ? J honestly hate writing on papers, my school has a full fledged computer lab, but they barely even use it, we had online exams and we're supposed to write c on papers, it hurts to know you have a computer right in front of you but your retarded teacher thinks writing is better than practical learning this is only gonna make some people hate excel Oh god, I had to do this for Paint back in the day. The teachers don't understand the purpose and utility of what they teach. I would honestly skip the question. Imagine one day excel tweaks it's UI and suddenly your questions aren't relevant anymore 100% true Our education system is mostly impractical. We have under qualified as well as underpaid teachers.

Lack of dialogue is hallmark of any University. You are supposed to just nod your head while studying. Discussion has no scope Bluntly put, this is symptomatic of a poor country. It is a problem that cannot correct itself by somehow enabling the poor to become financially independent - by way of many government schemes or a chaotic (or humanitary, i.e. charity) wealth distribution between the wealthy and the poor. (Poverty on many scales).

Many things have to fall in place. Some of them are good connectivity between villages and towns, affordable education, affordable healthcare, jobs, income tax, responsible governments, educated politicians...etc...etc.

It's a ""progress on many fronts""...the economy is an indicator of this ""progress"". But it has to percolate to all levels of society too...(But what is an indicator for this?)...It is similar to how a car moves forward when we put our foot on the accelerator...now imagine that car had a blunt gear system, or, no brake fluid, or worn out clutch plates...the car may breakdown...but the ride won't be smooth. Don't know whom to hate more, the teachers who put in such questions. Or the students who put on so much effort in a 5 marker, forcing others to also put in efforts"
jdhptj,,Our India!,Politics," The lotus is also part of the Indian bouquet. Just not the only variety of flower in it. What India says it is  v.  What India actually is This is what the Indian community should be on social media but that's not the scenario it's just toxic and filled with bullshit.
I still wonder what will happen if Reddit becomes popular in future y'all know how Twitter and other social media apps have become. India might not be the the flowers on the right but it's definitely not the one on the left. There are so many people that support bjp and hindutva parties that they got elected twice with so much majority, they didn't need to form a coalition, that hasn't happened in a long time. If we want things to change and get better we need to accept the truth. There are definitely a lot of lotuses in the actual India bouquet. This is the first post regarding India that doesn’t have polar commentators who side with just one view and are actually discussing. All power to grow and understand to the commenters here. This is how our real life discussions should be Such wonderful Caricature... 

In these times of injustice and chaos, We need to remind ourselves, What our beloved country, India, really stands for!

They don't care about religion, values, ethics or teachings, they care about one And only Political Party, BJP! And if we ought to fight them, we need to stand united, undermining our small differences we need to STAND AS ONE! Growing up, in our society, we have always experienced diversity of languages, regions, religions and sects. Our very own struggle for freedom has shown us that unity can be shaped in spite of such diversity. That is what made India so special. It stood as an important example for the claim that unity and diversity can co-exist. This didn't happen overnight, our forefathers struggled long and hard to achieve this unity in diversity. 

We are loosing this uniqueness and with that we are essentially loosing the Spirit/Soul of India. And the sad part is that people are happy about it. Yes I see the bouquet of flowers with all the diversity in India. I also see a government with a narrow minded agenda that follows other world leaders in causing oppression and segregation among the people, mostly to distract them while the government works to do things harmful to the people and beneficial for those in power. 

I see a country that lacks real infrastructure. Where is the government waste service or private firms to do this work? Why are there so many animals scavenging for food and eating literal garbage? Why hasn't the government imposed the spay and release program for dogs even though funds have been allocated for this? These are surface issues that make a community more responsible to their children, future, and community cleanliness as a whole. 

What it boils down to is accountability. No one is held accountable for actions. Not high rankers, not police, not neighbors, not parcel service, not criminals. Surely not the government workers that are happy to collect a paycheck without doing the work, and the supervisors that don't check! Everyone can be bought. At dominos they skimp on the cheese and tomato topping and Fed ex will take 4 months to deliver your parcel. It's ridiculous that people can't step up to complete the job and put india on a global map.

It's sad that with so many great minds and great people, in this motherland....that we have allowed it to become waste and filth filled with chemicals and refinement for lower price as opposed to the natural way of our history. 

While there are many beautiful places and peoole of india a shift in mindset of the masses needs to occur, and people need to propose an Indian solution and hold people accountable for that! चमन में इख़्तिलात-ए-रंग-ओ-बू से बात बनती है

Translation: can't translate the music in poetry but essentially *it's all the different colors and smells that make a garden, it's not really a pretty garden if it's just you or just me * India is home to 1350 Million people. Its more than 4 times the population of USA (320 M).We have a world of our own. Its sad to see how some old-ass power hungry clowns are destroying it just for the sake of staying in power for a few years. yess! Unity in diversity is what we've been taught since childhood.

Sosal Disasing Rallies offer free -two way transportation(inter-city, district, state) + good food (better than what most of these attendees have usually) + extra allowance (multiplies, if more people attend from same family) for attendees.

Remove all of this and you know, why election day turnout is comparatively lower. Kuch toh sochke hi kya hoga /s

ivrdr5,,"Met a player in Among us, Named Selmonbhoi dressed as a blackbuck xD",Non-Political," Does selmonbhai hunt? 🤔 Around a month back, while playing Among us, there were two people named Modi and Shah in the map. I was impostor,  Shah came in while I was watching cams in security. Got an opportunity, so killed. I vented to Medbay. Someone reported the body few seconds later. Modi started blaming me. I was really confused because I saw him entering Navigation on cameras before killing and there was no way he would have seen the kill. Everyone believed him and voted me out. 

Then I met Shah in the afterlife, he told me he messaged Modi as soon as I killed him. 

I hate cheaters in that game. Completely ruins a great game. Looks sus r/madlads Selmonbhai to foreigners: you wouldn’t get it He ain't imposter m 1000000% sure It's not SelmonBhoi, he's the driver.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-held-for-posters-critical-of-pm-modi-101621109330775.html

and the number will keep increasing. Delhi police are roaming around the city looking for more posters and people who put them up. So it's a crime to question the people you elected? It's not even insulting anyone. Just a question. The fucking audacity! I've seen what poster they're talking about. It is not disrespectful, not from any party, just a simple question. 
Edit: if you want to know what the poster was, there's a post I've made on this sub. Posters are such a menace to society. This is some amazing police work. I'm sure they'll all get medals and promotions.

And maybe one day this saga will be turned into a movie with our very own Caneda Kumar playing the lead role. [removed] Now, we all should just share that poster over social media to get on *his* nerves lol. Demokrisy🤡 Send me the poster I'll put some up! This is my theory take it with a pinch of salt. Modi is the frontman for BJP, he's the showman. BJPs success depends heavily on his public perception and his charisma. That's why BJP is trying to control the public narrative by censoring/shutting down any form criticism. Don't ever tell me India has freedom of speech It only took 7 years for fascists to take over a 70 years old democracy.

gvofxe,,The Last Conversation,Non-Political," This is so heart breaking! I can barely control myself from breaking down. People have sunk real low man! This enraged me to the core!! My anger aside, this (if to pust mildly) monsters had done what goes against the very existence of humanity. If you don't have the decency to live in harmony in nature, then you don't deserve the kindness of other human too. These people should be brought to strict measures against the Hate Crimes committed against animals.

I firmly believe ""Human mind is the most dangerous thing there ever could be"" It is being said that the pineapple was not deliberately fed to the elephant. According to the link I shared below, the fruit was intended for wild boar which often damage crops 

I'm not justifying their actions in any way, but there is a difference between harming the elephant with deliberate malice and killing one because of irresponsibility. Killing a wild boar using a method like this is abhorrent as well, let's be honest, no media would care if a wild boar dies.


[The News Minute Link](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/death-pregnant-elephant-kerala-pineapple-fir-lodged-against-unidentified-offenders-125820) This is so disgusting ....they should be punished for such brutality....I wonder how sick they must be to think of something like this This is a moment for shame for human race. 
How can someone be so inhuman. 
Imagine the plight of the the pregnant elephant who was innocent and blindly trusted human race 
What did she get in return .
I don't understand how can someone treat innocent animals in such a ruthless way. 
Just because we humans are more evolved in different aspects doesn't mean we have the right to go do what ever the f**k we want to. 
I can say humanity lies no more. BC ise dekh ke I think, we totally deserve 2020, everything happening with us is 100% what we deserve. Bc if dharti is an organism, humans are the cancer to that beautiful organism.

&#x200B;

[Source](https://twitter.com/satishacharya/status/1268019364382625792) Very sad, but just some clarification:

1. The elephant was one month pregnant.  I'm sure noone other than a vet could have identified this.

2. The pineapple filled with crackers was not intentionally fed to the elephant. Is a barbaric method used to kill wild boars that raid  farmlands (active hunting of boars is prohibited).

Doesnt make the situation any better. But these are the adverse effects of man-animal conflicts. Literacy doesn't mean Education. Education doesn't mean morals. No one 'fed' the elephant a pineapple stuffed with firecrackers. The elephant mistakenly ate a trap set for wild boars by some villagers to protect their farms. I in no way approve of this method to ward off wild animals. And the culprits should be handled by law appropriately."

edit: and its UP. UP strikes again satyameva jalate And of course it is U.P Why am I not surprised that this happened in UP Oh my god. Why do people do such horrible things? Rest In Peace. Too much democracy.. Does anyone have even a little amount of hope left that this country will be better someday? 

When I was little I used to skip whenever I read something this horrific, I always had this mindset that I will never be a journalist, I don't have the intelligence, power or strength to change these things, then why should I care?

Recently, I started paying more attention to the policy changes and the people. The more you read, the more you realise how much of an horrific place we live in. I realised how much privileged I am, to have the choice to ignore the news.

These things seem impossible to change, from corruption to caste, everything is so systemic. We may pretend that everything is okay, there are laws for untouchability, equality and corruption but then these horrific incidents do occur, beacuse we never acknowledge the problems with implementation and people, and I feel this will never change. And people are mad about AK vs AK"

But irony is if anyone asks questions on this then you become anti-national. 6 trillion economy. Just keep the one we have,  pathetic visions and bullshits. Could someone tell me what is the tax on fuel by central and state percentage wise And there are ""zero"" completely built electric vehicles which are made in india. If bhakts say there will be electrification throw this at their face, atleast we have vehicles which are completely manufacturered (90%) in India which run on petrol and diesel. We need to depend on china for electric vehicle parts bhakts. Fuel prices have never been this low in decades! Did i not tell you i will fulfill my promise?

-mudiji... probably If congress paid some money, we'd have celebrities tweeting about low fuel prices Udhar desh ka khalistani jwan sarhad pe shaheed ho rha hai ,

Prices will fall down magically and where are all those chu*iyas who said 35-35 ....... I have a feeling that Modi's going to increase the fuel prices all the way until December '23. After which he is going to decrease it a bit so bhakts can go on about how Modi is helping people by lowering fuel prices. Congress ki wajah se jo desh ki halat kharab hui hai uski bharpai karne ke liye Modiji ne taxes badhaye hain. (Bhakt Logic) Acche Din by BJP Man is shredding tears worth 100 Rs."
lkvax6,,Sshhhh!,Politics," As Sashi Taroor once said, *the only thing grown in India after Modi became PM, is his beard* First Police will arrest you in frivolous cases

As they say, when you stand by and watch when the fascists come for the others, there is no one left to speak up for you, when they finally come for you. 

The court let Kanhaiya be assaulted in the Court premises, which was shameful. If a court could accept an assault on an accused in custody, in the court premises, then there was no trust left in the judiciary anymore. 

This is just a step forward in what we have witnessed - Kanhaiya, JNU, Jamia Milia and this. If we still refuse to speak up and vote for these saffron bastards, then we deserve what is coming to us.

I really like the art. Whomever did it, it must be converted into poster and should be converted into digital Civil engineers !

what is it about society that disappoints me so much?


I don't know. Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man even when we knew he made billions off the backs of children?... Or maybe it's that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit. The world itself's just one big hoax. Spamming each other with our burning commentary *bullshit* masquerading as insight. Our social media faking as intimacy. Or is it that we voted for this. Not with our rigged elections but with our things, our property, our money. I'm not saying anything new, we all know we do this, not because ""Hunger Games"" books make us happy, but because we want to be sedated. Because it's painful not to pretend because we're cowards...

Please take care of people around you and reach out to people who are close to you. It's a pandemic.

My childhood friend and neighbour and his father both got covid. Uncle had other health issues like diabetic,etc. My friend was a fit 29 year old. Uncle recovered and came back but my friend passed away after staying in ventilator for 3 days.

Nothing about this disease makes sense.

Edit: Thank you all for your kind words. I hope all of you and your families remain safe. This feels like an never ending nightmare, I hope we manage to get through this. I wish, after this pandemic, all those who have lost their loved ones, create an organization to help each other and let the world know the pain they have gone through. People need to come together to help each other- that's the lesson we all need to learn because without this, we would not change a thing. Together, we can make ourselves strong. My sister's husband just survived cancer last year, they had two little kids were really happy... Passed away last night cause of corona... he was beautiful soul. The more you miss them and the more they have affected your life means you were lucky to have them! Miss them with all your heart and cherish the ones you have I'm sorry for your loss, friend. I've lost multiple close ones and friends already, some of my friends have lost one of their parents, some have lost both. Now my grandma is in the ICU. I hope there will be light at the end of the tunnel for those going through the worst of times. Stay strong buddy, sending prayers your way. Sorry for your loss. I lost my dad too. Science says death is because a certain organ of a body stops working. But beyond science, death is an emotional state where you miss your loved one. And the state is very weird because the fact is, you can’t bring back that person. That person is gone, permanently. I think goodbyes are completely okay but a goodbye where you won’t ever see that person aches the heart for a long time. I am scared of all these young people dying. Sorry to ask but did your friend have any underlying health issue? I'm so terribly sorry for your loss. May his family and friends find peace and survive this difficult time. Please take care of yourself! If you want to talk about anything to a random stranger just ping me. I'm of the same age group so I'm sure we will be able to relate to each other. Be strong! Same here, my best friend of over 20 years passed away just like that, I've lost other people to this pandemic as well but honestly this feels different. Things will never be the same, there were soo many adventures left to be had, so many trips we had planned, bachelor parties and weddings and milestones in life. I’m very sorry."
lvyahh,,Your honour. — drawn by Pen Pencil,Law & Courts," I was so angry.... I may be missing some info and misjudging the situation here.. 
But why is that even a solution. 

For people who missed it... 
Long story short, a minor was raped in her school days by a man, but once being caught he makes an agreement with girls parents to marry her when she reaches legal age.. But later when she grew up, he was already married and denied to marry the victim.. 
Now court offers him marrige or jail.... 
But WTF ? Never quite understood the point and benefit of ‘marry your rapist’. As if the rape won’t be rape anymore after marriage. As if the trauma she went through would just disappear after marrying the same person who inflicted such pain on her. Stupidity, insensitivity and irrationality prevails once again. I didn't see enough outrage about this incident in newspapers, tv or social media. Jesus christ(Or should I say Arrey Ganesha) what the actual fuck is happening to the judicial. First the POSCO judge, now the fuc...hon'ble CJI does this.

Fingers crossed hoping I don't get arrested Ab legega na Contempt of Court the courts which usually quote from mythology to serve justice ,should be given example from them to show how ridiculous they are. > ""We are not forcing you to marry. Let us know if you will. Otherwise you will say we are forcing you to marry"", the CJI added.

You'll be disappointed :)) Ek dailogue bolne do ki "" siachen main hamare jawan mar rahe hain"" these people will forget everything and again lick his arse This is so fucking true!! My father in law is in a critical condition since Sunday due to Covid. No hospital was ready to take him, the one that did said it would cost 12 lacs and more for the treatment. We were finding a bed for him till Monday late night and finally through a local political help, got a bed in a BMC Covid center. Mind you, we checked that same center twice already before and they said there are no beds. Through this connection we were able to get an ICU oxygen bed for him and got him admitted. It didn't end there, we then had to find plasma for him along with a donor. We went through hell this entire week and finally were able to get a donor and plasma for my father in law late last night. I am so glad for all the help of the political connection, the covid center and more importantly, the people that helped us with the plasma and donor. Really, i am very thankful although the point is, if we were not able to find that political connection, i am 95% sure that I would have lost my father in law. His oxygen levels came down to 73. He is doing much better now and we are hopeful that he recovers soon. 

 I am just so so so angry and frustrated at our Government, our Healthcare system, there is no support at all. It's all on you, you are here by yourself. This is the real truth!!! > Our job is to pay taxes.


Dumb Bhakts will argue many people were not paying taxes. We need a ' Janta maaf nahi karegi ' ad campaign the way BJP did against Congress before 2014 elections [deleted] Majority of people have dementia, they will forget this thing in 2-3 months. Wait for next “masterstroke” it was our job to not to vote on the basis of religion.  
it was our job to not to vote on the basis of caste.  
it was our job to fact check every whatsapp forward.  
it was our job to help the news organisations which were giving us news about our own society and were not in bed with the government.  
it was our job to NOT fight for temples and mosques.  
it was our job to not to make a hero figure out of someone so much so that dissent against them is not tolerated now.  
it was our job to not to bring a politician in power who was responsible for communal riots in his own state.  
it was our job to not to confuse country with the government.  
it was our job to look after every single community in this country and not ask them to go to pakistan.  


if people still think in a democracy people only have a responsibilty to vote and pay taxes then we have not learnt anything from this massacre Just let this 2nd wave die down a bit. People will forget it ever happened.

Welcome move by advertisers. I remember the news of big advertisers boycotting Youtube ads because their ads showed up on insensitive content. I thought then about how come TV is being left out since advertisers show ads on a lot of BS that plays on TV news all the time. There is a reason why its called Parle-G, G for genius. Finally, some change. Hope channels stop spreading propaganda. Now I am planning a road trip on my Bajaj Pulsar only eating Parle G on the way Hats off to these companies not just standing up but putting this word out to public."

Damn! I feel old. I cut the cord 18 months back. Never happier. Bill's cheaper. Seriously, ditched cable two years back.

The atmosphere in the house is of intellect than of a mindless zombie.

Youtube is king, parents watch it a lot, learn a lot from it too about different cultures, cities, recipes and whatnot.

But be careful of the yt algo, if you wach good stuff, prompts good stuff. On the contrary, one view of garbage and its a rabbit hole of garbage prompts.

Subscribed to good content creators and platforms in OTT.

You have control and you feel good. Same thing with TV news. Cut that garbage out entirely. 

At least with online news the quality of information you consume is up to you. You search, curate, find or trust your algorithms. You have no choice with TV—when thousands of people were dying of coronavirus, you would still find every single channel playing SSR news.

 I don't understand the point or appeal of TV news—you're just forced to give a shit about manufactured issues 24/7, which are basically just short articles with masala and background noise and screechy anchor added (unless it's NDTV in which case kudos to them for not going screechy and sticking with the level, measured voice).

I say manufactured because the fundamental nature of news sometimes is that ""event occurred"". That's the truth and all you need to see. But a TV channel feels it's their job to make ""OMG event occurred what is RaGa/Modi even doing"" or some other tripe. Completely rotten industry and I hope it dies.

At least with online news you can follow just the rabbit holes and issues that you like ~~like q-anon~~ Aunties can't ditch tv channels Fuck DTH. Showing the same garbage 24/7. I have completely discontinued using Tata Sky. Amazon prime and Netflix offer way more better content compared to those shitty TV channels.


The only thing worth watching on TV is IPL now. What's 221991? Enjoy it while you can. It'll be censored back to tv serial levels and desh bahkti ""news"" only. [deleted] Cut the cord in 2017. What I noticed more than anything is that I haven't seen any ads or commercials in a long long time. Can't believe I used to pay to watch ads. Just to help those who still own dumb TV ( not Smart TV), buy Amazon fire stick and ditch DTH. You'll be happier than ever."

If personal suffering caused by demonetization couldn't bring about a change of mind into people I don't what would do. People are completely brainwashed.

mmt176,"So that kids post got a lot of support on LinkedIn. (on 6th April)

At around 3 AM (7th April) I was reading someone's comment under that post and GONE. The post disappeared. I looked for the kid's profile and that was also gone.

Right in front of everyone, Byjus suppressed dissent. IS this BYJU's way of saying 'we don't care about your Freedom of Speech, we OWN entire media'.

I contacted the kid & talked to his mother, she almost cried over the phone sharing how Byjus people harassed her over her requests to cancel the EMI. The kid was really hopeful when his post got viral. But the next day (7th April) his post along with the account was taken down. And then BYJUs also deducted this month's EMI. Now imagine how would normal parents would raise their voice against this company?

There must be 1000s of middle-class and poor families right now trying to get their refunds from BYJUs. Left right up down, every media house is silent on this issue.

And then just a few hours ago on FB, I found this, someone with a new fake FB profile was trying to spread fake news, saying I called her and offered 50k to speak post against BYJUs.

[ Hope this doesnt comes under PI, as the account is totally fake with no connections. The likes are also most probably photoshopped because I didn't find any single post in this profile ](https://preview.redd.it/k4oo5w4psyr61.jpg?width=688&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b79b0fcecd8bf7199cc427d54a8f735f73368d44)

Like I talked about this in comments here sometimes, Byjus will someday make me the bad guy with their media power. I hope you guys, the place where this whole moment picked up stick with me for some time.

Also, two days ago one more post got viral on LinkedIn and it was from a current Byjus employee only. He exposed the toxic and fraud culture of Byjus. And guess what? This post also disappeared the next day.

4 months back WhiteHat Jr got my Twitter account suspended. And even after dozens of requests to Twitter India MD, Manish M., he didn't respond.In a way, these social media giants are treating us as second-class citizens. They don't care about our privacy, they don't care about our Freedom of Speech. If you ask for reasons for suspensions they don't respond and if you say I will go to court, they will say we don't come under Indian Jurisdiction. ""Wanna file a case on us, come to US first"".  Their software devs are mostly Indians, they make a good chunk of their revenue from Indian users, and most probably we Indians would be on top when it comes to the number of accounts on their platforms. And this is the level of freedom of speech they give to us.

I have created a new Twitter handle (pooniaV3). Kind of self-promotion but what else can be done. Unless our voices are not loud enough to shake their eardrums they won't care.

The hearing for my case is tomorrow morning, in Delhi High Court. I will be leaving for Delhi in few hours. If you support the cause let's meet on Twitter & make a change that matters.

Tomorrow morning (9th April), 10 AM on Twitter.","Remember that 14 y/o kid who wrote feeling guilty because of BYJUs EMIs, Byjus took down his profile from LinkedIn. And update for my tomorrow's hearing.",Business/Finance," And this is why I switched to Khan Academy. The fact that byjus is removing posts even in this on going court case shows how much power-grab they have on people Byjus business model simplified:

\~Fill the poor and middle class with dreams about their child becoming geniuses and force and harass them into buying their shitty service.

\~Use that money to sponsor the Indian Cricket Team.

\~On Seeing that, more people fall into the trap of buying their service.

\~Stonks. I wish I could do something more than just wish you here and a retweet there but I admire you man. Let's try to get this issue tending on Twitter tomorrow morning at 10 AM. And see till what extent the media dares to remain shamelessly silent.  [https://twitter.com/pooniaV3](https://twitter.com/pooniaV3) fuck byju's , fuck white hat junior .

jlcuqx,"36 years ago, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her bodyguards in Delhi on October 31. But what followed after was a state-sponsored genocide against innocent Sikhs. The sheer level of brutality that was exercised by the perpetrators, most of the whom belonged to the ruling Indian National Congress is something that cannot be described. Sikhs were burnt alive, our women were raped, Gurudwaras were destroyed and desecrated, hundreds became orphans that day. Congress workers were given money and booze for every murder they committed. That day, the Indian Government showed its true colours. Electoral Lists were also used to identify the victims and the Delhi Police openly let the pogroms happen. 

In total, more than 3000 Sikhs were killed (unofficial numbers are even higher) and the massacres happened not only in Delhi, but all across India.

However, there is something that isn't talked about. Majority of the perpetrators are still alive. They never got any time in prison. They are still roaming freely, you never know the man sitting across your table in a restaurant might have participated in the genocide. The Government even celebrated and awarded many of them. Leaders became MP's, MLA's and Rajiv Gandhi had the audacity to mock the victims when he openly tried to justify the genocide with his infamous "" when a big tree falls the earth shakes"".

People still don't know about how the judiciary was misused to provide protection to the perpetrators. We haven't received justice 36 years later. Sajjan Kumar going to jail after 34 years is a JOKE and he is just 1 guy. We don't deserve this, in fact, nobody deserves such mistreatment. People still don't know about the Ranganath Misra Commission appointed by the Congress which instead of providing justice to the victims completely exonerated (absolved) Congressmen from their brutal acts. The Commission outright rejected the majority of the affidavits filed by the victims as well as witnesses. It's no surprise for me that Mr. Misra later on became a Rajya Sabha MP for Congress.

36 years and no one wants to talk about us, not even the current Indian Government. People didn't support the Sikhs after the genocide. They voted the perpetrators back into the power and completely stereotyped my community, we became a bunch of 'drunk jokers' for the rest of the country, who would shamelessly be made fun of. Nobody talks about the victims, NOBODY.

We are all alone. Even in 2020, witnesses still receive threats and H.S Phoolka, a Sikh Lawyer who has fought for justice all alone still receives death threats. We don't see mass rallies in support of the victims, calls for justice and accountability of our Governments. My Grandpa was in Delhi that day for work. He was thankfully protected by the Hotel Manager, who kept him hidden for 2 days. My Grandma still remembers about how much she was crying because she didn't know whether he was alive or not. He ultimately survived and discreetly returned back to Punjab, 3 days later. 

The lack of humanity shown towards Genocide Victims in this country is absolutely appalling. We Sikhs haven't forgotten what happened to us but we need others to support us and to talk about the lack of justice. We can do this by educating people about the Genocide. Enough is enough !!

Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh !!",We need to talk about 1984 Anti-Sikh Genocide,Politics," I belong to a Sikh family. I wasn’t born yet in 1984, but my parents were married and my mom  was pregnant with my elder sibling during the riots. My father, turbaned, was caught in riots on way back home. He had to hide in a flat building’s staircase for 2 days to escape the killings/beatings happening outside. The people living in the flat were kind enough to give my father scissors to cut off his hair, but too scared to let a Sikh person inside their house. My dad cut off his hair but couldn’t go outside still because of the visible tan line on the forehead. My pregnant mother had no idea about his whereabouts for 2 days (no cell phones). My uncle (mamaji) and my grandmother went to search for my dad on expected routes, fully expecting to not find anything, or worse, just find his body. But they did find my dad and my grandmother still tells stories of how they verbally and physically fought with rioters to get my father back home. 

In hindsight, my dad got incredibly lucky. The only visible reminder of that time is his cut off hair. He did not tie a turban ever since.

Edit: My mother is not Sikh. So technically, my mamaji and grandma (mom’s mom) were non-Sikh people helping my dad (Sikh). This could have played a role in how they were able to escape to safety. My mother was a student in a youth hostel in a Hindu-Punjabi neighborhood in Delhi. They knocked on the door, and demanded that all Sikh girls be handed over to the mob. The warden and every women stood together and swore that all the Sikh women had returned to Punjab. In the days that followed, all the South Indian residents took turns to fetch provisions and stuck to the story.

&#x200B;

To this day, my mother refuses to vote Congress. Sending solidarity. 

To become a better country, India needs to reckon with the sins of its past. The persons who participated in this crime against the Sikh people, which was a crime against all humanity, deserve to be held responsible and prosecuted. Secondly, the need to educate people about this is paramount. It was not a spontaneous eruption of violence (""when a big tree . . ."" etc), but a methodical use of state apparatus to target the Sikh community.

There is no justification for genocide. I can't thank you enough for this post. My distant uncle was a first hand witness of this massacre. This should have been a rude awakening but was hushed down by the state.

""Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it."" It happened in 1984, it happened in 1993,it happened in 2002 and it happened in 2020 as well. 

And it will keep happening. Unless we confront the harsh reality that there is something fundamentally wrong with the system which allows Communal violence to be used as a political tool, which makes the police act as hired militia of the ruling party, which allows politicians to hijack the judicial system and get away with literally the most heinous crimes imaginable. An absolutely harrowing read indeed. I can only Imagine what the victims had to endure. For a country claiming to be a secular Democracy, this just makes us hang our heads in shame.

I remember seeing this video where the survivors were being interviewed. https://youtu.be/deJPImkb0v0 (Warning: Graphic content). And the little boy recounting his father's death was heartbreaking. I’m not Sikh or punjabi. The thing that struck me most is how non political people aka Bollywood celebrity (looking at you Mr Amitabh Bachann) incite communal riots without any retribution. He continues to enjoy the love and respect of 95% Indians. I lived in South Delhi during the riots. 

My family sheltered a Sikh family in our home for a few days before they eventually moved to a Gurudwara nearby for safety. I remember that there was no trust that the police would keep them safe so we did not call the police for help. 

We passed burnt houses and bodies in ditches on our way to school. Our car was stopped one night by a mob manning a barricade of burning tires. They checked our vehicle for any Sikh passengers. 
It was a terrible time. 

What I would love for my Sikh brothers and sisters to remember is that the overwhelming majority of Delhi Hindus were disgusted and terrified of the violence. No one knew where the mobs were coming from. It seemed to be a political vendetta, not public outrage, that was driving it. 

We had a fund raiser in school to help our Sikh classmate whose business had been burnt down. 
Our driver was a Sikh. His neighbors formed a nightly protective guard to keep the mobs away from the Sikh homes in their colony. 
The church near our home collected food and blankets for the refugees in our local Gurudwara. 

Most people are good at heart. Don’t let the actions of evil politicians turn us against each other. [Don't forget Amitabh Bachchan's role in 1984 riot](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/1984-riots-Why-nobody-noticed-Amitabh-Bachchan-spewing-venom-in-India/articleshow/10429011.cms) My mum recalled a story about how she had to buy groceries for our (at the time) Sikh neighbour because no one was selling to them. My parents had just arrived in delhi to get married as the murders started. Sikhs in the airport were cutting their hair in panic. My family is in the army so had a army car waiting for them- they thought they were safe. Hid a Sikh friend on the floor. The goons had the audacity to stop the army jeep, pull my mom out and leer at her. Said since she has short hair likely not a Sikh. Checked the car and only then let them go. An army jeep. They luckily didn’t check the car properly because my dad was in his uniform. The goons all had those huge knives. Any protest and my parents were sure they would be killed as well. They drove away ans their friend was safe. My mom said that the car in front had been stopped and she saw with her own eyes an elderly couples being stabbed to death. She told me the story so calmly. I was like wtf. This is not normal! She is still traumatized by it. This shows that no government is good for people. They will fucking kill everyone who comes in their way of gaining power and money. These people are monsters. Minorities are the best target for them cause no one gives a damn about them. Fuck politicians and fuck goverments."

Yo, WTF! [removed] Hi, I'm a technology lawyer dealing with privacy issues. Sadly, such a privacy policy is quite legal within the current Indian framework as long as it is published and someone 'consents' to it. Your consent is obtained through an agreement that you usually just click and accept, as we all do. The proposed Personal Data Protection Bill seeks to increase this standard of consent, but from a legal perspective it's absolutely not clear how that will be implemented at all. The legislation is also woefully inadequate. More conversation, awareness and outrage is needed on holding corporations to account, as well as ask our government to even put a modicum of thought into legislation on such an important issue. Itna to mai khud ke baare me nahi jaanta If this gets enough traction and upvotes, Airtel can be pressurised. This needs outrage and boycott calls. Bruh why the fuck they wanna know about my sex life?

Looking at the massive size of this owl, it might seem that spotting one is easy. Trust me, it's not! This mighty owl is a master of camouflage. It is found in scrubs and rocky areas, places like cliffs and on the edges of rocky hills. Inspite of being so huge, it blends in perfectly in its habitat making it almost impossible to spot. I looked for it for many years, with no luck.
However after all these years, I was finally able to spot it, that too at the heart of Pune city, after trying for around an hour on a hill side where I suspected it's presence. I was just about to give up and leave, when I finally caught it's sight. Truly exciting!

[""Despite doomsday predictions, India defeated Covid and helped 150 other countries: PM Modi at #Davos on January 29, 2021""](https://twitter.com/IndiaToday/status/1354957433152663561?s=20) The time scale is really misleading though. Gap between 3 days is same as 6 months. Source: https://mobile.twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1386584730359918592

>If we have to be honest, it is no longer possible to say “At least Modi is better than Rahul”. No one can deny he’s said the right things at the right time on Covid. Given this evidence, one could say if he was PM we wouldn’t be doing this badly on Covid.

>This does not change the fact that he’s a poor politician. So poor that he’s unable to even take credit for getting this right. But the people of India have to decide if all they want in a leader is someone who’s good at oratory. Can someone make a comparison chart with dumbshit BJP senior leaders said along the same timeline? Never voted before cause of the process but I'm registering my voter ID card and gonna vote. 

I'm an NRI who moved back so does anyone know how I should get started on this? Doesn't matter how much I ridiculed him in the past, he sounds a genius to me in the current situaltion. [removed] Rahul gandhi is way better than the sack of shit currently in the PMO. You don't even need to see what he is from covid prophesy but during first tenure they introduced something like NREGS. Which coming govt slammed but took shelter when it was need, take AADHAAR, FINANCIAL INCLUSION (PMJDY), Awas Yogja and lot many more If Stephen hawking suddenly became twice as smart in they middle of a conversation with you, would you notice?

Probably not.

Because for most of us, the theory of everything was already too far beyond our grasp and ability to understand.

That's exactly the situation that current regime and its supporters face when they listen to Rahul Gandhi, and he talks about love, science, economy, morality.

They laugh and mock him, because through a lens of hate, insecurity, and blind superstition, sensible statements sound like garbage.

They have branded him Pappu.

Because he is too smart for them to keep up with.

Next time India would be better if we listened to Rahul Gandhi or any other person who has something good to offer. I hope he capitalises on the current shitshow by the government..."

No bus, no train, no car, no motorbike, no bicycle! This happened already 5 years ago.

In India, I slept and lived shortly in over 35 local homes together with local families.  
Was invited to visit many schools and universities to give a talk to thousands of students.  
For many weeks walked in Rajasthan with over +42 degrees Celsius and many weeks in the monsoon rains.  
Camped a lot, got attacked by a dog and was escorted by a heavily armed Assam police force.  
Swam alone in the Ganges River, celebrated many big festivals like Diwali, Navaratri etc... Walked to Ambaji together with hundreds of thousands of walking Hindus.  
Visited the Barefoot College, Gandhi Ashram, OM Ashram.  
Had a very inspiring meeting world boxing champion MC Mary Kom and met the members of the famous Shilong Chamber Choir who sang 3 songs just only for me.  
Was asked to give many interviews and press conferences to local newspapers, television and radio...

Walking across India was part of a much longer walk in which I walked total 20,000 kilometres in 22 countries in 4 years and 3 months!  
PLEASE LOOK THE DETAIL ROUTE ON THE [MAP](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1kZST5-_lEISjBx_rAWfX5DkxQKk)

I have [**A BIG DREAM**](https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g0oovh/my_name_is_meigo_m%C3%A4rk_and_i_walked_20000/) to walk in different countries at least the distance of planet Earth's Equator which is 40,075 kilometres!

Massive respect to you my man. It is my dream to do something like this..... if you don't mind could you tell me how you went about it? Did you chart out a route beforehand or did you just go with the flow? Also what prompted you to start on such a trying and long journey? Hey thanks for sharing. That's amazing! Just curious, how much weight did you lose after those 7 months? How did you finance your trip? You Sir are my new hero. If you ever come back, I'd be glad to host you. r/madlads Great job!

jqy4nt,,Kerala Health Minister K. K. Shailaja on Vogue India cover,Politics," No offence but shit got out of hand. She's very good  good though people respect her more than the CM. Few months back Femina had the female army chief on thier cover and now this. So glad to see these magazines recognising real Women of substance rather than photoshopped and anorexic models She and Kerala admin have handled covid in a considerably good manner, no doubt about it.  
But, media houses have been too premature in concluding.   

Just a few months back, media claimed that Kerala had total control of covid. But in reality, the cases exploded and the effective number of tests done earlier were abysmal.   

Again, not bashing Kerala. Just the media. i am from  kerala although her planning made kerala coronavirus under control for few moths it lost control She is a beautiful person. I have met her. How is this not obvious bias? The media was too quick to label the 'Kerala Model' of coronavirus a success. By mid April, kerala model was lauded internationally and prematurely. The emphasis was on decentralisation(which imo is commonplace in Indian states). 

Post this, Kerala has slipped and how. 

Infact, Mamata Banerjee has done a better job in managing cases in a densely populated state like WB. Isn't kerala was a premature celebration? And it is still struggling to control the covid, while even Maharastra is recovering now.
Not a single state was able to control it properly.

Edit: juts saw few other people pointing out the same but instead talking about stupid media. While few other people still think Kerala did better despite the numbers show it is struggling and if I remember correctly even Kerala didn't report number correctly. So much for ideology bias here. My god this is so refreshing! What is this?

https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ipbxv7/kerala_health_minister_endorses_homoeopathy_for Please don’t forward or share this kind of information with your friends and family.

ldij3u,,Niece of Kamala Harris Meena Harris about the burning of her images.,Politics," IT cell: task failed successfully. Two months ago, the news channels were praising about the family of Kamala Harris. But now, it's seems that they are going to turned them into a anti-nationalist family living in USA! If Kamala Harris also comes out in support of the farmers, the next anti nationals are going to be people from Tamil Nadu. The government and their devotees have fired against India's ally USA. No joke, and this more sad than anything, 20 days without bail is nothing for politically motivated arrests. CrPC says 24hrs, from the time of making the arrest. Making the arrest=specific steps and paperwork. If you don’t do that paperwork, can keep arrested without producing in court.

Btw nice job 👍 Great work. Wow, that's brilliant. Can you please tell me how you did it ? I want to learn Whenever I see the pictures of old India, I always feel like something's wrong with this Modern India. In this picture, the roads look very clean, people were very well dressed, their appearance was top notch. It feels like we're evolving, just backwards (In some ways). I'd say that there's still pretty much work people and the government are doing through each other's corporation and help . And one day India will become as beautiful as  it deserves to be.🇮🇳❤️ Thats a pretty good work... So much Bhagva! Good job. Gives me a little cognitive dissonance in that the picture looks modern and the people's clothes do not. Sigh! Good memories from before corona-time. Yet everyone in the picture would have an average 3rd grade reading level. Appearances are deceiving."

But the chances of that happening are very slim. So at least somebody close from these politicians' families gasps for oxygen and dies right in front of their eyes. Probably then, these lot would understand what it feels like.

The problem with these people is they are so high up in the political hierarchy that the real voices and horrifying cries of the dying populace outside sounds like distant echoes to their already tone-deaf ears. Add to that they surround themselves with yesmen. And when asked the right questions, they shut every one down like some dictatorial and authoritarian regime that only wants to listen to its own high praises all day long.

Complacency is the biggest detriment to any field. Be it public policy, governance, academics, sports; whatever. The moment you think you have done it all, achieved everything or you have made it to the big time you start going downhill and in no time you are left scrambling to save face or go for damage control before everything goes bust.

The same thing happened with this govt. Self proclaimed victories like ""we have defeated Corona"", ""we are in the endgame of Covid"" in early January to conducting Kumbh Mela, State Elections.. these events just fuelled their growing complacency. And now everything the govt is trying to do, looks like they are trying to save face, make some last ditch efforts to make it look like they are trying to control the situation. The worrying fact is that the current wave hasn't even peaked. The situation is only going to get worse. 

This is a major catastrophe at the hands of the government and their hands are red with the blood of the thousands that have died gasping for breath. I wonder how the Prime Minister sleeps peacefully at night when there are harrowing sounds of desperate wails and helpless cries outside. Despite this, if he is still elected in 2024, then God help India. You forgot the Jio sim line. Nation of betas There will be one final queue in 2024 elections, where Modi will be voted out"

l1324a,,This will go down as one of the greatest Test Series ever!,Sports," Absolutely. Pujara is definitely the new Wall. For those who missed the match:
* The Indian team were heavy underdogs in the last match (on paper)
* The 4 Aussie bowlers had 1013 career Test wickets between them. The 5 India bowlers had 13.
* Except for skipper Rahane and Pujara, the combined match experience of the Indian team (50 odd) was half that of just one Aussie bowler (Lyon on 99)
* Washington Sunder, our only spinner in the game, does not even make it to his state Ranji team, bring the 4th best spinner for Tamil Nadu
* The bruises refer to Pujara being hit on his body about 10 times, some of which needed medical attention and yet he stood like a wall scoring slowly and patiently while grinding down the fast bowlers 
* Not least the team was carrying the psychological blows of multiple match injuries, stricter quarantine restrictions (and for longer) than the local team and that freak one hour in the first match that resulted in 36 all out/injured The Greatest Overseas Test Series!

Indeed, this series deserves a movie. What a rollercoaster. After getting bowled out for the lowest total ever, 36, to winning the series with a totally inexperienced team.

Kudos to Team India!!! Pujara put on an absolutely brilliant performance for you guys. Was a fantastic series, but we'll get you next time😊 Congratulations India from New Zealand.. fantastic match I did not understand the 'B' Team reference, what does it mean? Amazon better do The Test Season 2 around this series. As an Australian, well done. You all deserved the win! Victory is never easy. I’m not sure I have ever been as enthralled by test cricket as I was by the last two tests. All I can say is congratulations India, you should be proud of every one of them! I am not a fan of Cricket. I do not follow or watch any matches, haven't done so for at least the past 7-8 years.

Looks like I'll have to watch this series.."

hj3bva,,[OC]My first good shot of the Milky Way shot right from my rooftop in the middle of Pune [2318x3035][Nikon d5100],Photography," Settings: 18mm, 3200 ISO, f/3.5, 13s 

Equipment: Nikon d5100, tripod, Camera remote (Redmi 4 IR blaster)

Software: DeepSky Stacker, Lightroom, Snapseed

Stack of 55 exposures. Shot from Kharadi, Pune

Edit: Thought I'd give a process overview since people seem to be curious. Would also highly recommend the **PhotoPills** app because I use it extensively (it's not free on playstore but you can get it for free if you know what I mean).

####Setup:

* Select a good date and time for the shoot. Preferably plus-minus 3-4 days around the new moon and after the moonset so that the sky is as dark as possible. These details can be checked through the PhotoPills app easily- https://i.imgur.com/XBsflxO.jpg.

* Another thing to keep in mind while selecting the time is the orientation of the Milky Way. The Milky Way is not static in the sky and moves due to the earth's rotation. Try to set up the shoot at a time when the core of the Milky Way is well above the horizon (the region close to the horizon is highly light-polluted). Use the Night AR mode in the app to find the exact position of the Milky Way.

* Set the focus by zooming in on the brightest star you see and adjusting the focus manually till the star looks the sharpest. 

* Preferably use a remote to click the pics so that the camera isn't disturbed. I used my Redmi 4 as a remote as it has an IR blaster.

####Camera settings:
* Use the NPF rule to calculate how long your exposure/shutter speed should be. I don't remember the exact formula but the app does the calculation for you. Do not use the 500 Rule (500/focal length) as it doesn't take apperture and resolution into account. A good shutter speed is required to avoid star trails and getting sharp stars. In-app: https://i.imgur.com/KJRss2j.png.

* Use the widest focal length available to you and the widest apperture (18mm f/3.5 in case of a standard kit lens).

* Decide the ISO by clicking a few shots and checking the histogram to ensure you expose to the right. Here's a good link that explains what I mean: https://www.lonelyspeck.com/the-milky-way-in-los-angeles-light-pollution/

####Processing:
* Click at least 12+ minutes of total exposure of the night sky and about 20 shots each dark frames and offset frames. You can read about them here: http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/index.html

Total exposure is **Shutter speed x No. of shots**. In my case it was (13 x 55) = 715s which is about 12 minutes.

* Download the DeepSky Stacker software. It's free. It stacks all your pictures to give you a nice noise-free (nearly) composite with all the juicy details. It also auto-aligns all your exposures that will be misaligned due to the earth's rotation.

* At this stage the stacked pic you have will still look pretty plain. Load it into Lightroom/Photoshop and do some processing to bring out the details. (I used Lightroom and Snapseed)

n3wquh,"30 April, 2021. My father's phone was ringing and it woke me and my father up. The next thing I knew was my father crying and telling me that your mother is gone. I didn't cry at that time because I knew that I need to calm down my father first. My brother also woke up because of that. He didn't cried either, but he didn't speak anything either.

One of the reason that me and my brother did not cried was because we were expecting her death for a weak. I know my father was also expecting it but he couldn't control his emotions like us. After all he was giving it his all so that she comes back home all well.

I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/mv8o0r/my_mother/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) post earlier where I updated everything since the day she got admitted in a hospital for having corona virus. It was suggested to me by [u/Trick-Forever6426](https://www.reddit.com/u/Trick-Forever6426/). But there were somethings I didn't mention in that post, because even I didn't knew all those things.

When my mother got admitted in the ICU for the first time, it was because of the help of my cousin. He is working in that hospital. He told my father that there is a ICU available and that my father must make haste. But there were few things that he didn't told my desperate father. There were no doctors working in that hospital, only staff was taking care of the patients on ICU.

The put the ventilator tube in the throat of my mother without making her unconscious. The blood started coming out of the pipe because it apparently hit the lungs. My mother was yearning too much because of that pain. Later she signaled my father that she wants a pen and paper. Her whole body was shaking because of pain.

She wrote ""Take out the tube"". Which made my father broke into tears since he couldn't do anything. Her heartbeat stop 3 times and then my father started praying for her death. She was suffering too much. At that time, when hospital already killed all the other patients other than mother, my cousin admitted that there is a problem.

Hope arrived. Somehow my father managed to find a bed in ICU in a government hospital in Delhi which was near our home.  In ambulance, where she was last conscious, she told my father this.

***""If something happen to me, take care of kids and sell everything I own. Just don't spread anything in front of anyone.""***

And a week later, we received the final call from hospital.

Since my family was in a lot of debt in the past, my mother always said to earn honest money and never spread hands in front of anyone. She always taught me and my brother to never drink and get addicted to anything.

When she was a child she got bullied because she liked different things from everyone else. **She liked stars and everything humans didn't achieved.** That was also the reason that she never made a single friend. I like stars too. I always wanted to go even beyond stars, and uncover the mysteries of this universe and even the greater things outside this universe.

She didn't even got the chance to see me going to college. She didn't got the chance to see me becoming that one successful man she wanted me to be. She always wanted to live in the mountains, where she could see stars clearly.

She wanted to start a YouTube channel which she couldn't. She wanted to travel world with me and my brother. I wanted all of that too. I wanted that too.

She was more of a friend to me than a mother. I always shared every single thing to her, didn't left anything. Something minor happened in school? She knew about it. She would always come to my and my brother's room at night, and we always talked about the future. About the dreams we had.

She was the best. She would ask me regularly when the new doctor strange or black widow movie is coming out. Or when the new season of attack on titan or the promised neverland will come out. I wish I could have shown her the ending of attack on titan. Or the new marvel movies she wanted to see.

That's it. I will put some of her teachings here. I know these are commonly known but this is what SHE taught me.

1. Help only the people who deserve it
2. Don't do anything which can potentially ruin your life
3. Don't drink, I've only seen people destroying their lives because if it
4. stand up for the weak
5. there is a limit to helping people
6. help others only when you are able to help yourself
7. make sure to settle in life first, you will have all the time to buy things for your hobbies

At this moment of typing it, it feels like I am forgetting a lot of it. A lot of teachings she gave me. But I know I will follow them and be the man my mother wanted me to be. She sacrificed everything for me and my brother and always told us to do what humans haven't done yet. Go beyond and make changes in this world.

**EDIT:**

So apparently, some people are sending me religious advice and are trying to force me into cult like subreddits and clubs when I am at my weakest. A big ""fuck you"" to all of you. You might think that you are doing something good to me but no one needs to be depended on something to go forward in life. I do not need to believe in any kind of higher power or anything in order to move forward in life either.

When I said to achieve something even higher, I didn't mean that I want to spend my life worshiping god. And I respect those people who said that they will personally pray for me. I actually don't believe in anything like god or religion. If you take my word, I think religion is one of the biggest cause why people are dying today. Government couldn't stop the Kumbh Mela since they knew that hindu extremists will go on riots and people will be murdered. There are people feeding people cow's urine on ventilator (which is dangerous af) because they believe in pseudo science.

So please refrain from sending me any religious advice, I am an atheist. I appreciate you guys praying for me though. And I also appreciate all those people who prayed for my mother when she was still alive.

Lovely shot btw, good perspective, nice styling. Let me guess, Platform No. 9, Poorva express? Wonderful Perceptive. How do you get this color combination of something colored and rest all black and white? Do you use Photoshop or is it some sort of filter? Personally my favourite of Kolkata is Ballygunj Station, but Howrah's nice too! Cool man. I took my family on holiday to India last year and I can say comfortably I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE INDIAN RAIL SYSTEM. I thought that on the left, it’s all snow... 😂 Indian train stations have wholesome energy. r/itookapicture It almost looks it snowed there Amazing"

My father once went to donate his blood. They asked him to bring the supplies as well. Alexa, play nanmayulla lokame. I would always have high regard for this crowd than those queue up hours at any religious places or procession!

lmqc0b,,"Those scratches could have been serious trauma and damage to my face, jaw, and, head, had it not been for the Helmet. I wish more people use Helmets, not the half face variety as far as possible, and, seat belts too.",Art/Photo (OC)," I was involved in an accident 2 years ago. Skid about 20-30 feet on a wet slippery road. Both my right leg and right arm have permanent marks. I can't even imagine how my face would look if not for my helmet. WEAR A HELMET. Even while cycling Buy a new helmet. They can get structurally compromised in an accident. Get better soon. Yeah idk why people think it's cool driving without one... About a week ago, early in the morning, a serious accident happened nearby to my colony. 
A person driving the scooty slammed straight into an old uncle.
The driver died/is in serious condition ( not sure about him, getting mixed news about his well being). He was not wearing a helmet.
Both legs of the uncle were fractured.

But, what surprised me even more that no one came to help him. He was lying there on road, bleeding and was only hospitalised after the police came and called an ambulance.

So, it's not only a case of preventing any such accident, it should also be kept in mind that if you are in an accident, little are chances that anyone from general public will come to your aid. Good gracious! You ok dude? Get better soon!
I had a sort of minor accident about 3 days after purchasing my bike(my first and only). Was still learning how to ride/control it. Was taking it out from my society carpark(street level) when suddenly some small kids appeared from nowhere. They were a bit away from me but i got nervous, and slammed the rear brake resulting in the bike skidding. I lost my balance and both bike and me fell. I landed face first on the concrete floor.
Luckily i wad wearing my helmet with visor and only damage was some scratches on the helmet. If i didn't have it on, the concrete would have left those hard scratches on my face.
From that day onwards i never ever went anywhere without a helmet. My cousin and friends laugh at me for wearing helmet everytime I ride a motorcycle 
But I won't stop doing the right thing just because some jokers think it's unnecessary Sadly we live in a country where when people implement strict fines for lack of helmets, people cry about ""Why don't you find/arrest corrupt politicians"" and shit like that. 

It's appalling how far people are willing to go to not wear helmets. 

When our city implemented policies like no petrol without helmets, stall were brought up at petrol pumps where you can rent a helmet for 10 bucks. One of my classmates back in the day died while driving a motorcycle without a helmet. It wasn't even an accident. A truck came too close so he moved to the left and lost his balance on a pothole. Fell and banged his head on the footpath at minimal speed and was dead on the spot. No blood just internal hemorrhaging and gone in 5 seconds. So for people who think 'low speed me jana hai, kya jarurat hai helmet ka', don't tempt fate. Helmets are definitely a must. Get well soon, and keep driving safe. :) hope you do well and stay safe, my friend was also saved from an injury by wearing a helmet. i even wear a helmet when im going cycling. ppl should start taking helmets seriously. get well soon :)"
ioxtyl,"* Indian society hates women. It hates unmarried good-looking women even more. There is a reason why women like Draupadi, Sita and Shakuntala exist in our literature. They are warnings meant to educate you. If you're in the wrong place, you will be punished, and everyone will love to watch you burn. Misogyny is a part and parcel of Indian culture. It has always been this way and it will always be this way.
* Your biggest asset is your financial independence. This is the ONLY leverage you have and will ever have. Do NOT sacrifice your education or career for your family or children. Invest in yourself, invest in your future. Keep your finances separate from your partner. Do not trust anyone with your money. If your husband/boyfriend spends money on you, try to match it as much as you can. Do NOT accept free lunches.
* If your partner is paying for the house you live in, it is not your house. What belongs to you is only what belongs to you legally. Unless you pay the rent (and keep the receipts) or have the lease in your name, it is not your house. It doesn’t matter if you have lived in it for 6 months or 10 years. It is not your house.
* The Indian state is an extension of the Indian family. Deeply patriarchal and broken. Don’t rely on the police, media, or any kind of state apparatus. You need to know that you’re vulnerable. Only money and power can protect you. Acquire those.
* Indian society doesn’t believe in love. It believes in transactions. Indians pay billions of rupees to watch romance on-screen but for them, it exists only on screen. It is entertainment. Be careful with who you love. Do not devote yourself to men who don't deserve it. Shower your love on yourself before you give it to any man.
* What is considered fun for men, is considered debauchery for women. Indian society doesn't see women as humans who need to relax and enjoy themselves. If he smokes weed, he is stressed and needs to let loose. If you drink alcohol, you are a characterless bad influence. Remember this hypocrisy and have fun with only those who you trust. If you can afford it, travel outside India to have fun.
* Learn to think of relationships in terms of sunk costs. This is a concept in finance but it applies to life too. You don't need to stay in a bad investment just because you invested in it. Just because you gave a man 5 years in your past, you don't need to give him 5 years of your future. You can walk away anytime. Limit your losses. The past is irrelevant to the future.
* If you have to live with dignity on your own terms, you have to fight. You have to fight everyone and everything. You will be crushed often. But it is a price worth paying.

EDIT: Thank you, everyone, this post seems to have struck a chord with all. By and large, the response has been positive, and it is very reassuring to me to know that there are many sensitive and empathetic Indians willing to change the toxic mindsets they have been raised with. Reddit also seems to be the last bastion relatively free of Sanghi trolls. Let’s try to keep it that way!

If I can make an appeal- PLEASE educate yourself about patriarchy. It is a system so deep-rooted and insidious that it is often hard to recognize. Familiarize yourself with the works of Indian feminists such as Kamla Bhasin. You can start with her TED talk [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmmvM1NOI1s) Before I met her, I thought people were bigoted and they have to be ignored/challenged etc. But after meeting her, I realized that patriarchy is a system meant to perpetuate itself and the only way to be free of it is to recognize it within yourself and STOP living your life according to the damaging ideas we have all unconsciously imbibed.

Thank you again!",Lessons to learn by Indian women from Rhea Chakraborty's tragedy,Politics," 100% agree. Financial independence is a must for every women. My mom taught me right since childhood never to depend on anybody else for money and it’s the best advice I have ever received. [deleted] one big lesson: never use your own phone to contact your peddler. never use your phone to discuss anything about drugs. Coming from a rural areas these notes struck me a long time ago I am a male in my 20s and seeing my mom and how she was bought always tears me apart it gets me to the brink of tears. Her father is a headmaster but never welcomed her studying and after getting married dreams of becoming self reliant were crushed quick my grandpa and grand ma are good people but their ingrained patriarchy is sickening. Read a tweet a while ago that perfectly summed up this fucked up situation-

""In India a Dalit's merit,a Musilm's patriotism and a Women's character is always questioned"" As I read somewhere, “Rhea for most Indians is the symbol of all the cunning, jeans wearing, english speaking modern women who trap gullible men. They're all having their revenge on prime time tv.” [deleted] It's not just men even women look down on other strong women who act against patriarchal mindset. 

It's not men vs women. It's people who are patriarchal and people who are not. The most ""progressive"" of parents in India still jump onto the whole ""bad girlfriend"" trope, saying she ""pulled him away from his family"" and other such bullshit, when the truth is THEY can't go a fucking day without 2-3 calls from munna raja lol. Take this poor man's gold:

Someone else had made a post on here, when his family filed that FIR against Rhea, arguing that Indian families cannot accept suicides of their children, and love to find a scapegoat, in order to save face in society. I could not agree more. 

Also, SSR who has achieved a sainthood status on that cancer Bollywood gossip sub, wasn’t perfect. He has said some profoundly ignorant things about metoo, including aggressively defending his friend Chabra, who had multiple, credible allegations of sexual harassment. That sub was initially baying for his costar’s blood. When that didn’t materialize, they went on another witch-hunt.

hkwacm,,"TIL of Ghulam Dastagir, a Stationmaster who refused to leave his post during the Bhopal Gas Tragedy & saved thousands of lives by not letting any trains stop at the station. He spent the next 2 decades in & out of hospital due to long exposure to the gas before passing in 2003(X-posted from r/TIL)",Non-Political," I made a [post about him](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/hkjlzh/til_of_ghulam_dastagir_a_stationmaster_who/) on r/todayilearned and they loved him so I thought maybe r/india would too, couldn't crosspost here for some reason.

But the man is an unsung hero:

>""A hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles."" - Christopher Reeve  

>Thirty six years ago, on the night of December 2, 1984, Bhopal was hit by a catastrophe that had no parallel in the world’s industrial history. An accident at the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal had released almost 30 tons of a highly toxic gas called methyl isocyanate, turning the city into a vast gas chamber. The result was a nightmare; more than 600,000 people were exposed to the deadly gas cloud that left thousands dead and many more breathless, blind and in agonizing pain. Few people know that during the Bhopal gas tragedy a heroic stationmaster risked his own life to save others.  


>This is the little known story of deputy station superintendent Ghulam Dastagir, an unsung hero without whom the casualties in the catastrophe would have been much higher.  

>On the evening of December 2, 1984, Ghulam Dastagir was settling down in his office to complete some pending paperwork. This work kept him in his office till 1 am in the night, when he emerged to check the arrival of the Gorakhpur Mumbai Express. As he stepped on to the platform, the deputy stationmaster felt his eyes burn and a queer itching sensation in his throat.  

>He did not know that poisonous fumes leaking from Union Carbide's pesticide factory were stealthily enveloping the railway station. Beginning to choke, Dastagir did not know then that twenty three of his railway colleagues, including his boss, station superintendent Harish Dhurve, had already died. It was later reported that Dhurve had heard about the deadly gas and had immediately tried stopping the movement of trains passing through Bhopal before collapsing in his office chamber. His suddenly worsening health and years of experience told Dastagir that something was very wrong. Though he did not fully comprehend what was happening, he decided to act immediately when he did not get any response from the station master. He alerted the senior staff at nearby stations, like Vidisha and Itarsi, to suspend all train traffic to Bhopal.

>That night, the stationmaster's quick decision saved the lives of thousands of people who would have died had they been exposed to the toxic gas for much longer. But Dastagir's work was not done. The railway station was filling up with people, desperate to flee the fumes. Some were gasping, others were vomiting, and most were weeping. Dastagir chose to remain on duty, running from one platform to another, attending, helping and consoling victims. He also sent an SOS to all the nearby railway offices, asking for immediate medical help. As a result, four ambulances with paramedics and railway doctors arrived at the station. It was winter and the gas was staying low to the ground, a thick haze poisoning everything in its path.

>However, the catastrophe didn't leave him unscathed. One of his sons died on the night of the tragedy and another developed a lifelong skin infection. Dastagir himself spent his last 19 years shuttling in and out of hospitals; he developed a painful growth in the throat due to prolonged exposure to toxic fumes. When he passed way in 2003, his death certificate mentioned that he was suffering from diseases caused as a direct result of exposure to MIC (Methyl Isocyanate) gas. A memorial has been built at platform no.1 to pay tribute to those who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty on the fateful night of December 3, 1984. However, Ghulam Dastagir, who died later, is not one of them. A forgotten hero whose sense of duty and commitment saved countless lives, Dastagir's story deserves to be recognised and remembered by his fellow countrymen. Thank you for posting this. People like Ghulam are the untold heroes of this tragedy. It's extremely sad that the scum who were responsible for this tragedy were let go. Just amazing what humans can sometimes do during adversity.
Sad that he suffered from it for so many years along with so many others. The type of leader we need, but not the one we deserve, absolute hero Everytime the richest and powerful do fuck ups an innocent man has to pay the price. I still don't understand how people justify the existence of god. We did a play on him. Super cool guy 🙏 India news more such people. So many other railway employees were heroic during this disaster. As soon as railway station masters in Itarsi and Bhusaval realised something had happened in Bhopal, several railway employees set off to Bhopal by road carrying relief and medical supplies. I can't even imagine the courage it must taken for those men and women to deliberately head out towards almost certain agonising death when they had a choice to remain safe.

Modi Modi Modi !!! *India is still a Democratic Country.*

Seen this above sentence glorified in defense by blind followers. Usually by comparing India to extreme country like North Korea. Whats the use of current Indian democracy if its just an illusion to keep non thinkers in a made up loop. 

We can have freedom of speech, freedom of expression, etc and may get out without severe punishment but whats the point. We can go full bla bla blah with facts, proof and logic but higher authority is going to do what they want anyway."

Like the new [Ambani Mahal](https://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/billionaire-news/billionaire-mukesh-ambani-pays-79-million-for-british-golf-resort-made-famous-by-the-movie-goldfinger/) that has ""49-room luxury hotel, 13 tennis courts, and 14 acres of gardens.

j2nat4,,Justice for Manisha Valmiki. Artwork by Me.,Politics," Danny Archer from Blood Diamond: Sometimes I wonder, will God ever forgive us for what we've done to each other? Then I look around and I realize... God left this place a long time ago.  Their actions have no consequences. Why would they care? It’s like the wild Wild West for the police in UP. These cunts have normalised rape to a point, where the thing that makes us flinch is the physical trauma they inflicted, not the rape ●︿● I can't even imagine the horrors she went through. The horrors her family went through. I can't imagine something like this happening to any of my loved ones. I don't really know what to say or even if I should say something. I'm tired I guess. Rape culture has deeper roots in our society. To really tackle this behemoth problem our nation needs to have difficult conversation about caste relations, mysogyny, poverty, wealth inequality, education systems (including sex ed.), centralized political power, and government structures. 

No one in power really wants to takle any of these greatly important topics that shape our lives because that would require real hard work, and societal changes. Its just easier to hang people and move on to the next case. Another rape case has been reported in Balrampur, Uttar Pradesh. The victim belonged to backwards classes, gangraped, both legs broken, backbone fractured, injected with poisonous substance.

When will all this end, I'm really losing hope with each passing day. Are there any laws in India that prevent victims families from being abused and threatened. It's seems like a common pattern that these families gets threatened into silence by the preparator's family. Unless these victims or their family's can raise awareness to the media, their voices get drowned out. 
An someone living outside India, I want to thank you for the beautiful artwork and bringing awareness through your art about this terrible incident. Not even a single Upper Caste friend/Relatives of mine have spoken against this henious crime. They brush aside this news saying ""This is common, what can we do?"". But when Nirbhaya or Disha Incident happened, they were at forefronts angry, furious and frustrated at the Justice system which was ineffective, baying for blood of offenders. This is all one needs to know how this country works, who has power, who can scream louder and who suffer silently. Hi, do you have an Instagram ? 
I want to upload this on my story and wanted to tag you The only other person I know who was ""cremated"" like this, was Bhagat Singh.

I can't even think a government would stoop so low and deny any family of conducting the last rites of a loved one. The bodies of terrorists were given back to their families in J&K for a final burial. Sadly, being a Dalit seems worse than that. Really well thought-of OP. Aside from your obvious artistic talent, it really summarizes this disaster very well."

Thank you for sharing the picture. I hope you were able to provide seva and enjoy the feast at the Langar Hall. Beautiful picture! I was at the Golden Temple this time last year. 

This year, I'm stuck outside India unable to visit parents/home or the Golden Temple :( I have visted mosques , temples and gurudwaras . But i gotta say gurudawaras r one of the  cleanest place no matter which city also free snacks and food if u visit at evening during sunset u get tea biscuits and halwa , during noon langar. Man i wish i was born in a punjabi family. Very special place.  The spirit of the place and the people still resonates 10 years later.  Great shot! [deleted] The beauty of this gurudwara can only be realised when u see it with your own eyes. It's the most beautiful temple I've ever seen. It's the purest of experiences visting Golden Temple. The spirituality and holiness is just beyond anyone's expectations. 10/10 would recommend at least visiting at least once in your lifetime. Truly a life changing experience!

mokp3c,,"I was trying to register my mother for the vaccination only to find out that someone named ""Neelam Rani"" from Punjab is vaccinated and registered with my mobile number.

Its the person at vaccination center added your number and her details. They dont need otp to enter vaccine details. Doctor here who is involved in vaccination

From what I can guess, this is probably due to lack of quality In the online registration site. The phone number text box has an up and down mark which increases/reduces the value when we press the up/down arrow which is absurdly stupid.

Change the last digit of the phone number from 0-9 and search truecaller you will find who Neelam Rani is.

Edit : this issue was there in march, but it seems to have been fixed few days back My mom n dad are due for their 2nd dose. Still the cowin certificate shows dad as not vaccinated for dose 1. All I have is an sms that covaxin dose1 was given.

My dads number has two linked accounts, my mom and dad. For both it displays not vaccinated.

hc01o7,"This government has made so many blunders regarding Chinese intrusion.

First, they lied about the presence of any Chinese PLA movement near the border despite many foreign news agencies and our own news media reported it.

When it openly found that PLA is inside 2km of our Indian territory, the government released the statement that territory was never ours.

No other government has ever brought down the highness of the Indian army low by constantly lying and manipulating so as to protect the fake image of prime minister.

Shame on this government",Yesterday the government said there is no soldier of Indian army missing & today the Chinese gov released 10 Indian army soldiers. If the Chinese had not released them we would have never known about them. Indian government literally disowned our own soldier. This is what is call Anti-National.,Politics," [removed] I have to say the arrogance of the Government is going to lead to us actually loosing the territory. Let me just give  a little context. Our claimed LAC is upto finger 8 region. The Chinese claimed LAC is upto finger 4. As a result, for past several years, area between finger 4 and finger 8 was considered a disputed region. Both the countries, I repeat, both the countries were able to send patrolling parties upto their claimed point of LAC.

Now, China has setup upto finger 4. This means that they are already on their claimed territory and doesn't allow India to go beyond finger 4. 

PM saying we have not lost any land just strengthens China's argument that they did not cross LAC. Essentially, it indirectly means that India agrees to China's perception of LAC. Technically, the govt. said that all troops were 'accounted for'. That includes soldiers captured. 

The govt. just acted sleazy and withheld information. But they didnt lie. So you cannot hold them accountable for that.

For withholding info? Yes.

This govt. has reduced the army to an election prop. Fucking assholes. It is but to a Bhakt, eating Gobi Manchurian or using an Oppo device is more Anti-National than govt. hiding information. [deleted] My username checks out? The NDTV article itself says that they had the news but withheld it in order to not compromise the negotiations for safe transfer of the troops. This is a national security level issue and you want constant updates while you munch your popcorn without any regard for due process or the soldier's lives? Now they'll call you anti national for talking about national security. But if it had happened when any other party ruling us it wd be the mistake of the govt bt now it's army's mistake it seems for not patrolling properly or unable to fight the Chinese. Media has stooped that low. But they weren't missing, they knew where they were. From the early onset there were reports of Indian soldiers being captured. Though its technically true that all Indian soldiers were accounted for this doesn't mean they weren't captured. What's also interesting is that the Chinese foreign spokesperson also said no india troops were captured or no exchange of soldiers took place. This indicates maybe both countries had each others soldiers? And they want to downplay what had happened otherwise why release them without any photos or videos? Just a thought. >First, they lied about the presence of any Chinese PLA movement near the border despite many foreign news agencies and our own news media reported it.

Unless one Is completely unaware of the background.
Chinese patrol upto finger 2 and India patrol upto finger 8.  Brawl happened at finger 4. 

>When it openly found that PLA is inside 2km of our Indian territory, the government released the statement that territory was never ours.

Same as above. There is an agreement between India and China to facilitate patrols until the border is settled. 


Regarding  no one is missing in action statement. 


They are not wrong, we need to get the definitions right. 


>missing in action

Definition of missing in action

: missing and unable to be confirmed as captured or killed following military action soldier who was declared missing in action

There is a little confusion about the release. Army statement covers both the situations. 

There are not pows because it's a brawl.

kkvss1,,"1 vs 4000: Since I couldn't afford a Telescope or an expensive Star Tracker, I took almost 4000 exposures of The Orion Nebula over 3 nights with just an entry level camera from Bhopal. Merged them together using a technique called 'Stacking' and this is the result [Nikon D3100, 2909x1406] [OC]",Art/Photo (OC)," #Update: 
Thanks to you guys, News 18 picked up this image and wrote an article on it   
Link: https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/bhopal-photographer-clicked-4000-shots-of-orion-nebula-with-camera-results-are-stunning-3221126.html  

Thanks a lot everyone! You are awesome :)

#Original Post:

#Details:
**Left** is a Single exposure straight out of the camera on how the sky(and particularly the Nebula) looked. **Right** is what I got after stacking almost 4000 frames of Orion.

Orion Nebula is about 1344 Light Years away from the Earth. A nebula is basically a cloud of gas(mostly Hydrogen) in Space. These gases are the initial building blocks by which new Stars are born. Normally, you'd photograph a subject like this using a motorized tracking mount or at least by going to a darker area. I couldn't afford either of those things(the latter partly due to the current pandemic, mostly because I'm lazy) so I just took all these shots from my roof instead. I know that some other shots you may have seen of M42 are probably _way_ better than this, but the fact that I could even get some details on the Nebula from a Bortle Class 6-7 sky was enough for me. 

**If you like this shot, you can check out my other work on my insta @astronot_yet . I do Astrophotography with a cheap/affordable camera and try to demonstrate that beautiful night sky shots are possible even without driving hundreds of kilometers to a dark forest or to spend your entire month's salary on buying expensive gear.** 

#TIP:
If you don't like to read huge wall of texts, I would recommend watching 'Nebula Photos' on YouTube instead. He has a series on [
Orion Nebula WITHOUT a Star Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrzbdmripj1c9p7hzt7ffgH3oN8vzCFI3) and I can personally attest that the videos were immensely helpful irrespective of if you're a beginner or an expert.

#What is Stacking?  
Stacking means taking lots of images of the same subject, align them together and take an average of all the frames. This increases the Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR) of the image and reduces the random noise that creeps up in your photos. Bottom line: You can get really high details by stacking multiple images than using just one image. 
 
#Equipment-

Nikon D3100, Nikkor 70-300mm telephoto lens, a cheap tripod, a wired remote shutter(optional), Bahtinov mask (optional)

#EXIF: 
155mm, F/4.5, ISO 12800, 2sx3895 exposures


#Process:
1) Getting the focus right is the single biggest challenge while shooting objects like these. For my earlier attempts, I used to spend a _lot_of time trying to perfect the focus and taking far too many test shots to be sure, but then someone suggested to use a [Bahtinov Mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahtinov_mask). I couldn't find this anywhere online so I got it 3D printed. It was so cheap that the shipping charges were more than the mask itself lol. But trust me, a Bahtinov mask saves you a LOT of time and frustration.

2) Next, we need to locate the Orion Nebula. The best way is to download any star chart app, and use the Augmented Reality feature that most of them have these days. I used [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simulationcurriculum.skysafari5&amp;hl=en_IN) but you can use your own favorite.

3) Find the constellation Orion and point your camera roughly in [between the star Rigel and Orion's Belt](https://i.imgur.com/YKV4QW3.jpg). Orion Nebula is visible from the naked eyes from most locations and shouldn't be too hard to find

4) A remote shutter or intervaloemter is advised to avoid touching the camera again and again and minimize blurriness/disturbance. You can buy a cheap wired remote, or if your camera is fairly new it may already have an intervaloemeter built in. If neither of these are possible, just put your camera in a 2s delay timer and you'll essentially achieve the same result.

5) How to select your exposure length: If you set your camera's shutter duration for let's say 15-20s or something, what you will see are [star trails](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/ua/PegasusTrails.jpg) where instead of pin pointed stars, you'd see them moving in a line, ruining our shot. In order to get sharp looking stars, we use the [rule of 500](https://petapixel.com/2015/01/06/avoid-star-trails-following-500-rule/) which is essentially 
>Shutter duration = 500/(Focal length x your camera's crop factor)

Take a shot, zoom in and check the stars, if you see some trailing, lower your shutter length and test again. For my case, Nikon cameras have a crop factor of 1.5, so at the focal length of 155mm, Rule of 500 gave me 500/(155x1.5)= ~2s.

6) Take as many exposures as you can. YOU DO NOT NEED 4000 EXPOSURES. I only took so many because I aimed to expose Orion for at least 2 hours. With my settings that comes out to be 3600 exposures. If you're attempting this for the  first time, or if you're already in a darker area, 300-500 exposures would be good enough. DO NOT change any settings in between the exposures. It's a good idea to not disturb the camera at all while it's taking the shots.

7) Take a few bias, dark and flat frames. These are called ""Calibration Frames"" and their job is to remove any noise that is being generated by the Camera itself(senor heat, dust on the sensor, etc). [How to take these here](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/faq.htm#lightdarkflatoffset)

8) After all this, you can use any stacking software to process these shots. My favorite is Deep Sky Stacker and Sequator. Pixinsight is also a capable one, but it's not free so pick whichever one you like. The main job of stacking software is to align all the exposures and then sort of take an average of the frames which decreases noise and increases the Signal-to-Noise ratio of our image, so the final shot results in extremely high details and very less noise.

9) I processed the result in Pixinsight, and retouched it a bit in Photoshop.


Please note that this is a very simple explanation, and some of the rules and technologies I wrote above might have mistakes, or may not work in your case. Please remember, experiment and experience will give you the best results. Also, if I indeed made some mistakes above, please correct me.

Ask me if you guys have any other questions :) My god, my brain just exploded. Great job OP! Especially with the detailed explanation in the comment. Modern solutions!!! At first glance I thought someone from space research posted this. Really impressive buddy. Try doing the same for moon, if you do please tag me. Have been trying to capture one for quite long. This description really helps. 
Thanks a ton OP. That's so beautiful! Great effort OP Bro posr it in r/nextfuckinglevel or r/interestingasfuck

Its a different level thing you made Fuck this is amazing. Would the sky be rotating as you are taking these shots? How do you limit the amount of blur if the camera is fixated on the same area for a few hours? IQ = 999 Awesome! Love these creative methods to overcome constraints. Must have taken a lot of time though Could you share your post processing steps?"

i2537p,,"Left is the first ever Moon shot I took back in 2014. Right is a few days ago when I combined 1012 Exposures of the First Quarter Moon together using a technique called ""Stacking"" to improve details on the surface. Both images were taken with the exact same gear,in Bhopal[Nikon D3100,2400x1600][OC]",Photography," #Details:
First, please note that the right side image is a composite. Meaning I took three different 'types' of images and blended them together in Photoshop for Artistic effect. These are:

1) The illuminated part of the Moon: I took 1012 Exposures of the bright side of the Moon.

2) The dark side: I took about 100 shots of this a few days ago during the crescent stage of the Moon, overexposing it to get some details

3) The stars: Shot the stars separately with a wide angle lens.

My intention with this post is to show that you don't always need 'up-to-date' or expensive gear to take good shots. A bit of hard work (and watching lots of YouTube tutorials) can do the trick as well.

#Gear:
Nikon D3100, Nikkor 70-300mm lens at 300mm, a cheap ass Tripod, one wired shutter remote. 

#Settings:
The Bright Part of the Moon was shot at F9, ISO 3200, 1/400s. 
The other part was shot at F4, ISO 6400, 1/250s.

#Process and Software used:

1)Getting the focus right is the singular biggest challenge while shooting the Moon, so I spent a considerable time fine tuning the focus to get it as sharp as possible

2) Took more than 1000 Exposures of the Moon, and about 50 Dark Frames(which are basically shooting at the same settings but with the lens cap on)

3) Put all these into PIPP(a free software), which aligns all the exposures and uses the 'dark frames' to reduce some noise

4) Next, the aligned frames are imported to Autostakkert, which stacks all the frames together. This means that it basically takes the average of all the exposures to increase the Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR) of the final resulting image. 

5) This entire process was followed again with the 'Earthshine' frames of the Moon.

6) Final processing was done in Lightroom, then I added the star background and the Earthshine image, and blended the three shots together in Photoshop.

Please note that this is a simplified explanation, but if you have any questions and/or doubts or if I have made a mistake in the above explanation, please do tell me :) Is this where I make the analogy of 'Me on Aadhar card photo' vs 'Me on Instagram'.

je0e98,"After The Ken and Morning Context published their articles, WhiteHatJr and Byjus stopped putting down my videos. But they are still putting down videos of other people, in a much more aggressive and rampant manner. If your videos or posts go down, please let me know about them. I want to keep a track of every single content they are taking down.

So when they couldn't put down my videos, they restored to harassment. I started getting messages (from WhiteHatJr teachers, mutual contacts between me and WhiteHatJr) that I must back out before EOD else they will file a defamation case against me. This felt real and tbh intimidating to some extent.

Then from WhiteHatJr One Lady Director (let's call her WOLD) started giving me legal threats over LinkedIn. She claims I somehow harassed her. I took my elder brother's suggestion to not reply to her threats and kept doing what I was doing. So for 6 days, I didn't reply to her comments. But she just didn't stop, started calling me *'a coward', 'a\*\*', 'doesn't have guts'* for not replying to her comments.

I somehow stayed calm and didn't respond to her threats. She kept saying she would file a case over me for defamation and harassment, and that I will get a legal notice in a week's time.

Meanwhile, Karan Bajaj, CEO of WhitehatJr posted two articles on LinkedIn, in both, he tried to divert the topic and ignored all the questions and concerns that were raised. He basically used his daughter's example to point out that coding is a good tool to enhance learning (no one objected to coding as a part of the curriculum) and in the second one he gave the example of his mother, an army officer's wife, a total emotional route he took there. And somehow justified all the false advertisements of WhitehatJr.

There were some people on LinkedIn who were opposing WhiteHatJr and suddenly they started talking nice things about WhiteHatJr. This was alarming to me. I saw how they were trying to press the issue and move on. And on my posts, WOLD kept instigating me. She even made a new Twitter account to push me more, she kept saying she will file a complaint against me kept calling me a coward.

Finally, I confronted her over LinkedIn comments and told her that I am not scared of her false allegations. I said I am waiting for your legal notice, **TO THIS SHE SAID "" I am letting you go on Humanity grounds'.**

For an entire week she threatened me, bullied me over LinkedIn and Twitter, their teachers called me 'dog' (yes they did), their trollers started calling me 'Pakistani guy' over youtube comments. But when I faced her she had no reply! IN FACT, she started tagging LinkedIn and Twitter telling them that I am bullying her by tagging her in comments.

This was too much for me to ignore. I collected all the snapshots of her threats, made an article on LinkedIn, documenting how she bullied me with her threats for an entire week. AND GUESS What happens next?

My article went down from LinkedIn within 8 hours! AND she disabled her LinkedIn account.

I reposted the article ALONG with the proof of how they suppress dissent, a snapshot of a post by WOLD on Workplace telling their 13k teachers to report my post. This is how they tackle dissent by attacking like a mob, putting baseless false allegations, threatening, and bullying, getting content removed like it's nothing.

Till now they haven't replied to a single question of mine.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FAQ: Why am I doing this?

Won't go much into my personal life. In short:

* Kota Coaching life. I know what happens there. How aspirations are turned into a rat race. I have also seen Bansal Classes, the most formidable institute of its time going down. Whitehatjr and Byjus are nothing in front of that.
* IIT. Did it even though I never wanted to do engineering. I like other subjects more. Society makes people run after silly tags.
* Software job. I know no one gets a 150 crore salary, I also know coding cant be learned the way WhiteHatJr is trying to teach. Maths and coding cant be learned by spoon-feeding. Only intrinsic desire to learn it can make someone a good coder, not extrinsic rewards such a salary or tags. WhiteHatJr will just create a huge crowd of below-average coders who won't even be employable.
* EdTech Company experience: 8 months of exp (2017) in one such EdTech company showed me how ugly this sector is. There is no education and no tech, only sales and marketing. CEO of that company clearly said in a meeting ""we are not in the education business, we are in money-making business"". I left that company then.
* UPSC preps: I know what kind of depression follows after such failures. I missed Interview calls twice by a single digit, one time by 9 marks, and next time by 8 marks. I feel I have seen the darkest days and somehow came out of it. As an adult, I think I can comprehend how it would feel to a 13-year-old when his/her pipe dream of 150 crore salary (just like wolf Gupta) would break. Teenagers are most prone to depressions. WhiteHatJr can put an entire generation into life long depression.

Pradeep Poonia",WhiteHatJr Lady Director is harassing me with false harassment allegations and Legal threats.,Non-Political," Just to clarify something.

We fully support Mr. Poonia on the issue of ed-tech companies engaging in misleading marketing. There have been incidents that have shown us that there is a deep cultural problem in all these nouveau ed-tech start-ups.

People have been asking us why Mr. Poonia's posts/comments get removed etc. If a post/comment breaks Reddit's or [r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india)'s rules, it will be removed.

For more information, please refer this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/je0e98/whitehatjr\_lady\_director\_is\_harassing\_me\_with/g9c61ls/](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/je0e98/whitehatjr_lady_director_is_harassing_me_with/g9c61ls/) I've been following your posts for a few weeks now. I have huge respect for you and what you're trying to do. Good luck, I really hope you don't let the scammers win. [removed] 

You can (Threaten to) Sue WhiteHatJr.

For cyberbullying u/s 67 of the Information Technology Act of 2000. Can't you take legal action against them? Like for misusing copyright and scamming people and for harrassing you? >their trollers started calling me 'Pakistani guy' over youtube comments.

-_- Man this is insane. I am glad you are taking a step against such an obvious dickhole of a company. I can’t do much but I am willing to support your efforts anyway I can. Keep up the good work. We don’t want more disinterested parents ruining childhood for another generation by being fooled by predatory companies. Buck has to stop somewhere. I really admire your effort, I hope this subreddit allows you to get more people on board with this and help end this.

The IIT-JEE coaching industry has flourished by feeding on the aspirations of so many middle-class parents, promising them that their kids will be super-successful only if they make it to an IIT, and have in general created such a toxic and overly-competitive environment.

Now they're shifting focus from the 16-18 age group to focus on younger kids.A place that already used to do online coaching for JEE, NEET etc has also started coding classes now to compete with WHJr. Their top class for kids of grades 1-2 costs 50k INR and one of the things taught is ""How to create a YouTube account""

If we don't stop this now, this plague will spread to everything in the realm of education.  


Edit: I read your story and noticed that the WOLD wants people to learn English first.  
I'd just checked out their official YouTube channel and the comments of one of the videos(the one with Audrey and Dexter) someone asked if they can teach in Hindi. I'll quote the exact thing:  


**Sai Super Music:**   
Sir can you study my kid and my kid can make app  
**Reply by WHJr YouTube:**  
Hi!.....<Asked them to book a free 1:1 session>  
**Sai Super Music:**  
Can the teacher say in hindi  
**1 Reply, by WHJr YouTube:**  
Hi! We do not differentiate on the basis of language and provide learning opportunities to all irrespective of whether they speak in Hindi, English or any other regional language. We strongly believe that language should never be a barrier when it comes to learning :)   


Isn't it weird that their director doesn't share their views? Great to see you have done so much. Seeing that you are ready for a fight with them, why don't you take the initiative and send them a legal notice for harassment and other issues. the screenshots of messages etc will be help your case.

Try reaching out to a few lawyers, some might even help you without charging high fees. If you can, please post screenshots of these messages too. I'm not on LinkedIn anymore so can't help you there.


A word of advice (you may have done it already, but just letting you know in case you haven't done so): Keep multiple copies of EVERYTHING in multiple formats. Talk to a lawyer about how to preserve documents such that they can be used in court. WhiteHatJr and Byju's is clearly very scummy and they will have good lawyers – they WILL get down and dirty if your protest gets too popular. 


Ask your lawyer to talk with the local police station – keep them in the loop. It is important that you contact them first, before they contact the police.


Keep it up dude. You've completely swayed my opinion of these companies and your crusade is very gutsy and brave. All the best. We're cheering for you. Poonia Bhai aage badho, Hum tumhare saath hai.

m0xvuh,,Interesting ad by Oyo in The Hindustan Times on Social Networking sites safety.,Business/Finance," What exactly are they doing, are they culling such comments from their own website and social media handles? Or are they calling out such comments on social media in general? Ironically they hire the creepiest staff. Man this is the reason I uninstalled facebook. Fuck that website. Filled with sexist and racist bs. There's only so much negativity I can take. Now only use messenger to keep in touch with friends and reddit. Marketing Gimmick And some dumb people say that we shouldn't speak of these things on internet because it gives a bad impression of Indians.Bruh. That looks like a guy and its a marketing stragedy to appeal to people . Fun fact: OYO’s owner himself requested a white lady to not report her rape which happened in OYO hotel. It's just a joke. 

Also why isn't Oyo taking steps to prevent the rapes that happen at their hotels (just look up their wiki). One of the rapes was committed by an Oyo employee. 

Girls can block and reply to creeps on social media, they don't need Oyo to white knight for them. What they need is an actual commitment to make all the hotels safer for women. Virtue signaling at its finest. A lot of you mention that they hire the creepiest and rapey staff and their properties should prevent rape from happening.

Firstly, OYO operates using the asset-light model, they partner up with existing hotels and bump up the quality of service, or atleast attempt to keep it at an acceptable standard. So the creepy dudes and unsafe accomodations is not quantifiable right? How can OYO as a brand look into the miniscule day to day events of a partner hotel? And that too at 800 bucks a night.

Second, calling out the creeps is  a show of support, they are getting actual people to monitor their handles and ensure that women aren't the target of these trolls. That's just a nice thing to do,  there is no ulterior motive. It is not necessarily safety of Social Network more like trolls and so on."
m4ua6x,,BYJUs BDA feeling proud of putting a lower-middle-class family into an EMI trap.,Business/Finance," I get such stories from their current and ex sales men quite often who left the company out of principles. But here some BDAs are proud of looting poor parents. 
It's a shame that engineers are not getting jobs in their core sector and are turning towards Byjus for sales roles. There their entry-level role is of 'senior education counselor where they go to innocent families and make them sign into the EMI trap. The Electrician father in the picture must be making 20-25k pm and now he invested more than he can afford for a better future for his kids. Much better quality content is available over the internet for free, but he got fooled by a suited-booted educational counselor. Now he if tries for a refund most probably he won't get it. Imagine the number of lies this salesman must have told after this the poor father must have asked his kids to tough his feet! Such narcissism My best friend used to work in byjux as the salesperson. They had a training for about 2mos, he was taught all the dirty tactics and chose not to. The problem is that these sales people themselves don't find a good job otherwise, and they're indirectly made to do the dirty work (they have their family too). It's a downward spiral. Sad to watch it happen in my country. We need educated people doing good business, not businesses making education a business. The peer effect on the parents and their children is also real. Everyone knows what happens then, end up buying stupid shit. ITS SAD. If such a sales team actually try to educate people in a good way (and still make fair profit) I won't really have a problem. He also cried about it . Smfh Scam the poor, drink their blood and become immortal! Five long “ears”? Or years? So this BDA trapped a gullible hardly working father in EMI trap who can't even pay the emi. Karze par karza!! Getting it how ugly it is. And I get calls from their BDAs and so many of them tell me how they are being pressurized to sell their crap to even the poorest of poor. I saw this post today on LinkedIn and since morning I am feeling so anxious and angry. FK!! This is so Fing wrong. They came to my college for interview. One interesting question they asked was ""You are a water bottle salesman, you met a rich man who owns multiple hotels in a desert where he is thirsty and about to die of thirst. You being a water salesman, what would you do?""

The person who got the job said ""I would ask the Hotel owner for an agreement to supply water on all his hotels for 5 years and THEN give him water to drink.""

Talks a lot about company policy. I worked at Byjus for 5 months and generated a revenue of around 3 lakhs, eventhough I was open with all the parents that I met and I'm happy to say that I didn't shove this shit product down anyone's throat.

I consider the 5 months spent there as utterly ridiculous and waste of my time and energy.
The worst decision of my life.

lbd1v5,,Ya better turn it off,Politics," did it so many years ago. there was only so much 'breaking' news i could handle [looking at you, aaj tak]. Media, Indeed. Stopped subscribing to media channels in set top box pack last year. Better late than never. Fear and paranoia sells a lot. Do you guys try to avoid news ? I am just trying to avoid all kind of news wether left or ight or whatever . Instagram has been  tough tho some of my friends post stuff and some influencers i fookow too.  I mean good for them they are trying raise awareness but this is taking a toll on my mental health genuinely think i am going crazy Looks like RNation. And now its time turn twitter off as well. Idk how many times I have been thinking on this. Social media is a place where everyone is google they just know everything. You just have to pick a point to say either political or anything they have the replies ready be it logical or not. Mainly political even if they read their comments, they might get confused because they are senseless. Only way is just to let things happen as they are going on. Because the way people are brainwashed there is nothing we (I) can do. Nobody looks it in a way that may be that can make sense. So better stay away and let it happen. When it will reach to your neck then we will see, rest its just fine. Idk here in community either most of them are current government hater or they actually think. But its just make sense when i read the post and comments here atleast most of them are not just blaming and talking nonsense. I like that but still we are heading towards worst time rapidly.

ij5oes,,"I took these images in 2017 at The Gwalior Fort. Couldn't get any details out back then due to the insane Light Pollution. Yesterday I got back to them & manually processed and merged 160 different exposures using a technique called ""Stacking"" and this is the result. [Nikon D3100, 4608x6144][OC]",Photography," #Details:
First, please note that this image is a composite, meaning I first focused my camera on only capturing the Milky Way exposures, and then, I took one shot of The Gwalior Fort in the foreground and blended them together. The entirety of this image was taken from the terrace of my Grandfather. This was taken in Bortle 6-7 skies of Gwalior so pretty much the upper limit of Astrophotography (any more and it would be impossible to get ANY details at all)

My main aim is to show that you don't necessarily need professional gear costing lakhs of Rupees or to drive hundreds of kilometers to a darker area(especially in current times) in order to photograph the Milky Way. It can be done right from your own roof with just a simple DSLR and a laptop(and admittedly, time. LOTS of time)

#Equipment-

Nikon D3100, Nikkor 18-55mm kit lens, a cheap tripod, one remote shutter(you may be able to use your phone as a remote as well if your camera has Wifi)

#EXIF: 
F/3.5, ISO 800, 15s x 160 exposures,
20 Darks, 20 Flats, 50 Bias frames


#Process:
1) First you need to locate the Milky Way. The best way is to download any star chart app, and find the constellation Sagittarius. I would recommend Sky Safari(free) or Stellarium(free on PC)

2) Point your camera roughly on Sagittarius. As long as Sagittarius is in your frame, Milky Way will be as well.

3) Use the widest available lens you have. I took my shots with just a kit lens that came with the camera at 18mm. This is to get as much of the galaxy in our frame and also to avoid star trails(I'll talk about that in a minute)

4) You're going to need a remote shutter to take the images without touching the camera, because whenever you touch it, it will impart some vibrations to the camera and your exposures will have some blurriness. You can buy a cheap wired remote, or you can put your camera in a 2s shutter delay which will effectively do the same job of vibration attenuation in the end.

5) How to select your exposure length: If you set your camera's shutter duration for let's say 30s or higher, what you will see are [star trails](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/ua/PegasusTrails.jpg) where instead of pin pointed stars, you'd see them moving in a line, ruining our shot. In order to get sharp looking stars, use the [rule of 500](https://petapixel.com/2015/01/06/avoid-star-trails-following-500-rule/) which is essentially to divide 500 by your focal length(times the crop factor) and set the shutter time as that. Take a shot, zoom in and check the stars, if you see some trailing, lower your shutter length and test again. For my case, Rule of 500 gave me 500/(18x1.5)=~18s, but it was still a bit traily so I shot my exposures at 15s.

6) Take as many exposures as you can. If you're already in a darker area, 50-60 exposures will be good enough. I took 160 because of the insane light pollution near the Fort. It's a good idea to not disturb the camera at all while it's taking the shots.

7) Take about 200 bias, 20 dark and 20 flat frames. These are called ""Calibration Frames"" and their job is to remove any noise that is being generated by the Camera itself(Heat, dust on the sensor, etc). [How to take these here](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/faq.htm#lightdarkflatoffset)

8) After all this, you can use any stacking software to process these shots. My favorite is Deep Sky Stacker and Sequator. BUT, shockingly they both failed back in 2017 because they are more automated and the light pollution was a little too much for them to handle. However, since I know a great deal more in 2020, I manually processed these images in Pixinsight. The process was quite long, and my 2.7 GB data ballooned up to about 128 GB by the time I was done, but it was worth it in the end. [Basic Pixinsight Manual Workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU5jJgjKuQQ). 

Note: The main job of stacking software is to counter the Earth's rotation by aligning all the exposures and then sort of take an average of the frames which decreases noise and increases the Signal to Noise ratio of our image, so the final shot results in extremely high details and very less noise.

9) I retouched the result in Lightroom, then added the foreground in Photoshop


Please note that this is a very simple explanation, and some of the rules and technologies I wrote above might have mistakes, or may not work in your case. Please remember, experiment and experience will give you the best results. Also, if I indeed made some mistakes above, please correct me.

Ask me if you guys have any other questions :) ayyy im from gwalior.  incredible piece man Excellent I think i kind of saw something similar in one of Johnny Harris's videos. Woah! Also is that the milky way galaxy? ( I am dumb) Amazing picture... Post this to r/space and r/pics as well. With a night sky like that you can probably understand why Humayun was hanging out in his observatory the night he fell down the stairs.

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/love-jihad-manufactured-by-bjp-to-divide-nation-ashok-gehlot-2327913 Our own families have been taking away our personal liberty regarding marriage for a long time. Now people are trying to do it at government level. Sorry i am not familiar with most of the stuff in the outside world or politics, can anyone unbiasedly tell me what love jihad is and why does everyone keep talking about it? [removed] We need more politicians speaking out like this. [deleted] He literally said the words ""as a man I cannot marry a girl(and vice versa) into different religion without the consent of the government's whims despite being an adult in the world's largest **democracy**."" Its sad honestly that a concept call love jihad exists

People should be free to fuck or marry and fuck whomever they want

We should have a uniform civil code though Kudos to him for speaking out that too from a proper Hindi belt state. Bravo... Ashok Gehlot speaks up but Rahul Gandhi? The heir to Congress's throne? Why is he keeping mum on this issue? As Liberal, its just painfully pointless to bat for him if he is going to behave like this! 

And Rahul Gandhi's selective outrage is the reason Muslims don't believe him anymore... Bihar shown quite a middle finger to him! What is the exact law coming out against this ""love-jihad""?? Are they even allowed to do something like that."

the good thing is that a SOP was released few days ago which would/should eventually take care of people without local ids. but the process seems to be so complicated that it might end up remaining on paper alone.

A cruel, undemocratic policy design in such a poor country. The Purge: Modi-fied Typical. Being poor in India is a crime. It seems the rich always get away with everything while the poor always suffer. I think Bhagat Singh had it right, before we catered to the colonists and now we cater to the rich indians. I dont think we ever left colonization from a mental and societal standpoint. 

&#x200B;

Sorry for the rant brothers and sisters, its dis heartening to see a country with so many gifts all go to waste. Best Wishes. Pradhan mantri garib hatao yojana Before the vaccination drive was opened up for everyone, Vaccination centers allowed walk-ins for all eligible people (who were 45+ at that time) and the registration happened on spot so that people who are not digitally literate can avail vaccination.   
Yes I agree that even then an identity document like Aadhar card, voter id, PAN card, licence etc was required. My understanding is that most people(but not all maybe) do have one of this documents, even the poorest of poor have some card with them which they use to avail ration and subsidies etc. For example this [website](https://apolitical.co/en/solution_article/india-created-largest-database-residents-identities-planet?share=copy&uuid=article) tells me that 99.5% of 18+ population had an identity document in 2017. For the remaining 0.5% population, relaxations should certainly be made in the mass vaccination campaign  


Now the government has restricted/reduced walk-in vaccinations especially for 18-45 population because supply is less and hence number of vaccination centers and slots are less and they want to prevent crowding, This is not the best scenario, this should not have happened but I hope that once we have increased supply from July-Aug walk-ins will be allowed for everyone and people without access to internet/mobile phone would be able to get vaccinated as well, and I also hope for the minority(0.5%)  which does not have a document according to source I linked before, relaxations will be made and they will be accommodated. I believe these  poor people need money , food more than vaccine as their livelihood has been completely destroyed due to covid 19."

I used to check accounts on twitter and saw how most were newly created. This thing is, unfortunately still going on. Can someone please explain this? I'm a little out of context here Can't believe how much trolling was done to Mumbai Police. When people were being beaten in Delhi by the police and Mumbai police was protecting its citizens who were protesting! Calling them meme police shame on everyone who participated in this BS I have realized it depends a lot on the behaviour of general public too. I was born in UP , did my schooling in Gujarat & am presently pursuing my bachelors in Pune. I have observed that the behaviour & work ethics of police in Maharashtra & Gujarat is way better than UP or say Delhi ( again in general , there are good & bad officers everywhere ). One of the reasons is that in Delhi/UP if someone gets arrested , they threaten officers by saying "" Mera baap MLA/Minister hai , tera transfer kara dega "" . Most of the time public use their illegitimate power to close cases in judiciary & get bails. The police feels useless as their hardwork in apprehending the criminal  goes to waste. During the old days , UP police was quite strict & the work ethics were quite similar to Gujarat or Maharashtra , but as time passed they ended up becoming slaves to the govt. in power. How dare this cartoon contradict Arnab Goswami, the Right wing messiah-cum-Autopsy Expert-cum-Modi's loud moaner? If you ever been to Mumbai, Mumbai Police is one of kind... I mean Handling 1.84 crore population, With all sort of high profile and influential people living around, plus Mumbai as Rajdhani of Maharashtra so always on high alert, Mumbai Police are immensely strained Police department in India! Yet, You will never meet Such humble, helping police officer anywhere!

Here you go anyway 🥇 You did the sculpting as well? Brilliant. Especially the detailed lighting/reflections on her dress... very impressive What tablet/software/pencil (stylus) do you use? Amazing brother. Loved every bit, especially the arch and the pillars. This goes without saying, you're talented and I'm sure you'll channelise it in a proper way which will bring you satisfaction and accolades.

Like others have mentioned, if you have any page dedicated to this, do share, if not, create one. Do post your new works whenever you can Nice artwork!

More importantly, is she single?          /s Looks like Amita for Far Cry 4 Nice.   
Edit: jaya aur sushma when? This looks amazing!
I'm a bit curious and I don't mean to sound like I'm hating on your hard work, but could you please explain your lighting and shadow process to me? Because the arc or the doorway she's standing by from the inside seems dark and the dove is flying inwards and almost fully lit and so is Rekha. 

Shouldn't there be an edge light or silhouette around the character models? I could be wrong though but I'm just curious to know. Wow. Beautiful."
gre6rf,"On 5 February 1996, Mumbai Police conducted a raid at Kamathipura, Mumbai and rescued 456 survivors of sex trafficking between the ages of 14 and 30. Out of these 456, there were 128 Nepalese, and 50% were under 18 years of age.

But when Mumbai Police contacted Nepalese Govt, they refused to help them bring back to their country, because they had no birth certificates. It was an even worst situation for those 128 Nepalese girls.

Neither they can be in India, nor reach Nepal.

It was then that Suniel Shetty took the matters into his own hands. He booked tickets for all 128 Nepalese girls, made arrangements for their departure from India and ensured that they reach home safely.

And the biggest part.. He kept silent on his heroic deed for 24 years, since revealing this incident and the names would have jeopardized those girls' future.

This was recently revealed by Charimaya Tamang, one of the survivors of that raid 24 years ago. In an interview with Vice, she revealed for the first time how Suniel Shetty helped them, and saved their dignity.

Charimaya now runs an NGO which works against sex trafficking and the rehabilitation of the survivors and has won Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2013.

One act of kindness by Suniel Shetty, without any media hype and drama, changed the lives of those 128 women, and triggered a change and movement which will continue to help and support thousands of more women.

Big salute to Suneil Shetty, and his selfless act. Simple incredible!

How much time did it take to create this?

mlxvvi,,Godi Media,Politics," Corona is allergic to Kumbh Mela and electorial rallies. But it can spread in solo car driving so wearing a mask is compulsory according to Delhi High court. If bullshit could float, godi media would be admiral of the fleet. I would understand if a RW person would say all this but what fascinates me the most is these news anchors were all trained journalists with years of experience in their field even before 2014. How did they manage to throw everything away. Were these guys always like this? Also while they are covering Kumbh Mela and Modi's Political rallies favorably, they are simultaneously shitting on random people from Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala for not wearing Masks and social distancing and blaming state govts that are not BJP.

They have no shame. Surely bhakts who are part of the channels and people watching it at home, must have realized it by now? Right?

Example:  ABP news on [Yogi](https://i.imgur.com/UuJXv3b.jpg) and [Bhogis](https://i.imgur.com/0CeItcl.jpg). Most of my friends and colleagues can clearly and logically see problems in ideas of white supremacy in the west, islamic caliphate dreams in Turkey, etc.

They talk about how dangerous and damaging it is to use this as a political tool.

I didn’t want to leave without my belongings. Then a policeman got very angry and twisted my elbow. I’m old but not a very weak man. I used to wrestle a lot, so I managed to unhook my elbow from his grasp. While I was doing so I touched the policeman’s uniform. I wanted to keep him away so he wouldn’t hit me. But as soon as I touched his uniform, he started screaming for help and shouted that I was assaulting him and trying to tear off his uniform.”

Delhi Police : This old man is touching me, help me beat him!! 

What a bunch of sadists that enjoy beating old men who were just serving food.

Again, the guy was not at Red Fort. So, the Bhakts should not bring that argument in this comment section. The sad reality is, that the ones who has made our country so regressive are the ones being treated as gods ! The Delhi Police haven't changed their mentality.

So fuck them honestly. I don't want anyone to show sympathy to these fucking cops, who justify taking multiple turns to beat old people.

 they were cursing freedom moment, They cursed everyone who stands for india , they killed Gandhi, they licked Britishers foot 

Now they are branding every one who dares to question their loyalty towards country, 

For them licking boots of high n mighty is the way of life. This is sad, but hopefully this won’t go unnoticed and these fuckers will have to pay for it. Delhi Police have stopped water tankers from entering Singhu area. Human Rights are a joke Sad to hear an old man who gave a lot to the country  being called names because he took a stand.

hrgjfg,,No Community Spread,Coronavirus," My father got covid 19 while operating his small store in a non containment zone area. Yep, no community transmission indeed. First step in solving an issue is admitting there's an issue. So as long as our central govt. Is running around protecting their fragile ego, people who are not fortunate enough will keep on dying. Up, up and away At this point, it doesn't even matter. Everyone knows community spread is there.

If everyone starts wearing a mask and do not break social Distancing guidelines ,only then everyone can be safe.

All I see is people behaving like covid is not even there right now. Arogya Setu: community transfers?, huh

They are going to see massacres.

Bitter but real. Even if there's no community spread, which I highly doubt,  shouldn't the Govt act assuming there is community spread? [source](https://twitter.com/satishacharya/status/1283027519436812289?s=21) A textile company in my state (HP) got sealed last week when there was a sudden hullabaloo of community spread wherein the manager of the company spread the virus to 10 other persons and those 10 spread it to 30 others, the manager belonged to other state namely Bihar, was denied entry into the state but he somehow managed to cross the border of HP at night not knowing that he was infected with coronavirus ; he managed to skip all necessary border checks and once arrived carried on his work in the company until it was discovered that he was corona positive ; he had already infected 39 people within the company when it all became known. The company is closed ever since. It will go on till NO COMMUNITY TO SPREAD The worst part is when they did lockdown, instead of doing random testing and treatments most govts were just slacking around Kerala government has already admitted to community spread. Every day along with the daily infection statistics they also mention how many cases have been reported with no clear source. I think right now it's up to 26% in Kerala."

Full Freedom House Report: https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2021/democracy-under-siege [removed] Apparently, a foreign conspiracy to undermine Modi. I will wait in twitter for response from Cricketers and Bollywood actors! Grandparents got vaccinated yesterday, and it was quite strange to see Modiji's photo on the vaccination certificates. My dad remarked that it's giving him 'supreme leader' vibes. Wah kya scene hai! I realised why Bollywood keeps a blind eye on politics and atrocities happening around !

Government starts breaking your back until you can't even stand on your own. So many freedom fighters fought for hundreds of years and died for this country’s freedom. 

Here this government reverse it in 7 years. As Yogendra Yadav said yesterday, the only language the present regime understands is of the elections. 

We need to let them have 'Vote ki chot' (abrasion of election) in coming state elections. 

It will take great effort to amend or reverse laws like UAPA, regulations on online space etc. Just change in the regime won't do. But that is the first step. Just wondering how does it work with Telegraph? The TV mouths propoganda bullshit day & night and the newspaper goes all ballistic and truthful in print. Any idea if any major papers like Times of India, Hindustan Times, Dainik Jagran etc cover it ?

Telegraph is very bold but has very limited reach. [deleted]"

Great job bro. Would you share how a single layer of moon shot looks like? Please put a watermark and share the high.res please.

iu0pkn,,Full businessbaazi 😎,Non-Political," AIR'ers get paid by all these companies to use their name and photo in such ads. Many students take distance coaching from many institutes, enroll in crash courses of others and attend regular classes of others. 

But also, many of these coaching inst. offer money in exchange for ads too. So this doesn't surprise me a lot.

 This could be either of them or both. [deleted] This was a really old tactic. Even back in 2006-7 time, colleges like Sri Chaitanya and Narayana in Andhra Pradesh used to claim ranker students as their own in multiple ads. They even used to print both ads on the same page of a newspaper. If asked about legitimacy, they’d say that student studied 12th in one college and went for entrance coaching in another. So it’s a win win for both of them. And they paid the students well. Entrance exam business is super mature and fucked up in AP way before all these came up!! She must have given mock exams by all those institutions, that way they can all claim her as a student. Times like these I wish I studied harder xD I'd be so rich 🤣🤣🤣 Why?

It's bizness. 

Why ? 

I listen to da money. Anyone wants to estimate how much money she would have earned from all this? Like 5 lakhs - 10 lakhs? BYJU brought this business model to every class topper in every school. We are insecure gullible Indians, the business companies know that. Nothing new. This was rampant even in the early 2000s as well. This covers their undergrad expenses."

i2pvxd,,Helped distribute some food yesterday and the smile of the kids meant everything. Please don't forget to donate food these days if you can as many still haven't received any benefits.,Coronavirus," Loved their smiles. And the food looks delicious. Thanks for the good work, dude. Proud of you man! Will try at my end too Where are you based in? Are you part of an NGO? This is a beautiful act. I hope you can do more to them than suppressing their hunger for a single meal. Connect yourself to your local community shelter and try to see what's the best option they would receive now. All the best 👍 That look of pure joy is priceless! Your amazing :) We used to do this when I was back in Indian. We called it Happy Birthday Bharat.

Every first Sunday of a month we would go to a slum and celebrate birthday of all the kids there. We gave them new clothes, shoes etc as well as had a cake cutting ceremony.

If anyone wishes to do the same its very fulfilling. wonderful! All of us can’t do things on a large scale like Sonu Sood. But we can all do our very small efforts that will help others. It gives even you the most happiness you will ever experience while you help someone. Kudos to OP!! God Bless you a million fold for feeding this beautiful child... her sweet smile is enough to fill your heart and know you’ve done something good ... I personally don’t think it’s humiliating or degrading for a child to have her picture taken... and by looking at that smile, she definitely is happy to have someone take her picture... those that are saying it’s wrong because of privacy or dignity issues, should look at the context the picture is taken, and who is the subject. How many times do you think someone asked this little girl to have her picture taken ? My guess is, not many, to be frank... probably no one. So, the idea that someone values her as a person to not only feed her, but to take her picture is a pretty incredible thing for her... and clearly she’s so happy, and ultimately that’s all that counts ☺️🙏 Wow! They look really pleased with the food. Since the lockdown began, my Dad regularly provides food to street dogs. Sometimes, biscuits worth ₹300 or so on a single day. Many dogs were starved due to closure of shops during initial days. I’m glad he’s doing this. The wiggling tails and pure excitements of the dogs when the see us is amazing. And this is done by a man who hated dogs and even hurt few during his youth days."
l5f00w,,Long long time ago when things were done in silence,Politics," India was the biggest maker of vaccines in the world even before Covid-19. I think most people in India don't realise that. We have been exporting vaccines to other countries for decades even BEFORE Covid-19 owing to the cheaper manufacturing costs and expertise available here. India is also the world's largest generic medicines manufacturer and exports them to other countries all the time.

So once you know these facts you'll laugh at how Modiji and BJP are making these things all about themselves as if they invented the vaccines themselves or something. What congress did really wrong is play quietly and steal. Bjp on the other hand ia loud, obnoxious while stealing India was already super capable of carrying out massive vaccination programs. Polio vaccination drive is one such success story, and you can read the ground level details on one such drive in 'The Mop Up' chapter of 'Better', a book by Atul Gawande. (Previews are available on Amazon on Google Books).

The Biotech capabilities are also very good here, but apparently from the recent events the Biotech bureaucracy is horseshit. In spite of all this there will definitely be several shameless attempts to hijack the work of scientific and medical researchers and thousands of healthcare workers and volunteers to make it all about Modi and BJP delivering the ""Made in India"" vaccine to India. We didn't have social media back then though [removed] Both silent PMs of India. But one has the media bought yet didn't do a single press conference, the other was a highly intelligent puppet. The tragedy is eventually on the citizens. We are emotional but we think less. We have the internet but we are still so gullible and susceptible to manipulation. I was one of them folks. I was one of those people who criticized Manmohan for this very silence.

EDIT 2: I'm amazed how some people are instead criticising me (for *whataboutery*) and the BJP, while giving a free pass to the Shiv Sena, typical of how conservative news channels broadcast their trash by freely mocking everything else, but not daring to utter even a few negative adjectives about the party of their dreams.

You can view the original painting here...https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/woman-holding-a-fruit-raja-ravi-varma/6gF0Oy3EKSRBhg

Raja Ravi Varma's paintings were recreated with famous Indian models and actresses for a calendar shoot last year by renowned Indian photographer - Mr. G Venket Ram. https://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/malayalam/2020/feb/05/ravi-varmas-stunning-paintings-brought-back-to-life-in-lensman-g-venket-rams-2020-calendar-2099400.html 

Mr. Venket Ram's original series of photos - "" Recreating Raja Ravi Varma"" served as my reference image for this painting and a few more to follow.

Gujrat model is here What baffles me is the sheer number of bhakts STILL defending the best CM by bringing up Rajasthan rape. Since when does two wrongs make a right? What kind of fuckall logic is this for a defence? 

The most important question of all though, is there no humanity left in our country anymore? Not all media is dead :') Why are these shitcunts working against BJP now? Surely there's some inner tug of war going on. Maybe a faction within want to depose that bald cunt. I'm quite suspicious of media almost in a sudden going against the Bjp Govt. (Maybe that poor Soul really knocked senses into them) ""Government is tapping the phones of the victim's family's""  
Let this sink in for a second. This is not a country of law. It is a circus where the powerful are the ring masters Can't believe I am saying this, but a UP Government formed by the Yadavs and/or Mayawati sounds like a wishful breath of fresh air at the moment

Edit: to be clear, all of the options here are absolute sh\*t and deserve no celebration in a country with such erudition and unrealized raw potential walled off (but not out of reach) from politics The Surveillance State is now a reality. There is now the capacity to make tyranny total in our country. The only way that ensures we don't fall deeper into this abyss is to vote this government out. We cannot afford to loose the freedom that our forefathers fought so hard to gift us.

Please vote, understand what's at stake. The events that have been unfolding in the past few days is not acceptable in a democracy. Freedom is not something that anybody can be given. Freedom is something people take, and people are as free as they want to be."
igp3m6,,I'm the westerner who did the Thali. Here is my version of Panipuri with roasted & puffed chana.,Food," that's a fancy presentation.

we are used to eat ""thela wala"" panipuri! I love pani puri and Indian chaat! This is an awesome presentation-I love the idea of putting the pani in shot glasses. I’m definitely going to use this. NOO!! That chana 🤭 who’s gonna tell them It said roasted puffed chana I I needed a minute Glad to hear that you didn't take the chana out of the cooker I haven't had them since the lockdown began more than 5 months ago. looking delicious #ԅ(¯﹃ ¯ԅ) 

I want to eat this. My parents always joked about them marrying me off to a panipuri wala because of my panipuri addiction. Coming to think of it, it's not such a bad idea. In their words 'Even if she is dying and somebody offers her panipuri, she'd come alive'. 😂

Awesome work with the Indian food. Must try pav bhaji next! I’m just gonna go out on a limb and put this across - no one puts chana in panipuri, yo.

That said, I think the presentation is awesome! Almost makes me want to eat it..... Loved it.... also its either the curd or the golgappa water....its very rare( where i live) to be served both at the same time [deleted]"
i7inbs,,Air India thanks the people of Malappuram,Non-Political," Menaka must be going bezerk right now. [Link](https://twitter.com/airindiain/status/1292802456326299648) to the post. It is a known fact that when aircrafts have crashed in India, people come to loot the aircraft and passengers belongings. Even cops guarding the crash have been reported to steal things from crash site. But in Malappuram, people ensured the aircraft was secured and people rushed to hospitals. Shout out to Menaka Gandhi for calling Malappuram a terrorist district when something not even related to terrorism happened in another district (elephant died eating a firecracker trap set for wild boars) without even bothering to check the facts or news and not even apologizing after the whole stupid idiotic press conference. Mmmm wasnt malapuram MOST VIOLENT PLACE in India by Maneka Ghandi. Seen and ignored by Maneka. Happy that there are good hearts existing still in this world I love and respect the idea and my heart goes out to the victims and their family, but oh my god these Air India marketing assholes can go fuck themselves. Their offices have been plagued with bureaucracy and corruption. Their planes have been poorly maintained for years. They're lackadaisical in following standards. 

On 11 Sep 2018, an Air India flight in New York couldn't land because of multiple instrumental failures and it was a miracle they got out safe. This is one of multiple such incidents.

Now after a huge failure that cost lives, instead of owning up and doing internal reviews, they're going to sweep it under the rug and focus on bullshit feel good branding memes like this.

I don't need to see brave heart memes, that can wait for later. I want to see heads in Air India roll because this can't just be a one off incident. Anyone knows the emotional trick used here? Before someone blames you, you appreciate a third person, denying which will be considered heartless, then everyone engages in praising the third person and no one points a finger at you. Well played Air India PR team. Now before anyone say that I am being insensitive to the people here, know that that is the whole predictability of this post. Maneka hasn't just left the chat, she has rage quit. Thanks Malappuram , Very Cool! Terry loves when a calamity brings people together."
k5p5i6,,"Dharampal Gulati, the owner of masala brand MDH has passed away. He way 97 years old.",Non-Political," Tuning Asli Masale Sach Sach in my mind while I read this news. It's 2020 guys. I have been burnt multiple times before. Not believing it until I see news of his burning pyre. Om shanti. A life lived greatly. He started from a very small chakki in Delhi and went on to become spice leader of India. A truly rags to riches story. Fun fact : Once for his recordings the actor didn't show up for the advertisement, and he was like "" fuck it, I'll be the actor of the video"" and boom. The video did really well and from that day he became the face of the brand. Your contribution to this nation was immense sir. Masala dadu. That's what I called him. >Even at an age where most of his peers retire, the 97-year-old owner makes his daily round of factories, markets and dealers including on Sundays until he is satisfied everything is in order in the company where he holds 80% stake.

Damn, A tough cookie yet it's 2020... Waqt hi saala boora chal raha hai... RIP MDH wale chachha💐💐💐💐 2020 is now Officially the worst year. It killed the immortal MDH man. He was 98, not 97. 
RIP, what a legend Born in Sialkot in 1923 (now in Pakistan), he entered India as a refugee at 17 years of age, sold mirrors, clothes, furniture, soaps, operated a horse carriage but survived.

Opened a small road side spices shop at Karol Bagh, Delhi, then bought a small shop at Chandni Chowk, and then a small factory at Kirti Nagar, and created a spices empire unparalleled anywhere in the world.

Rs 2000 crore operating income, Rs 400 crore net income and highest earning CEO of any FMCG brand in India. 

Mahashay Dharampal Gulati, 94 year old founder and owner of MDH, donated 90% of his earning to charity is no more.

He created a legacy, set an example for entrepreneurs and gave a message that with the right intentions, nothing is impossible.

RIP I was expecting him to reach 100. Nevertheless, he lived a great and a long life. RIP That guy had more energy than me."
iv5j7d,"Hello, BYJUS is online bullying me.

1. First, my first twitter id (@WhiteHatSr) got suspended.
2. Then my Quora got suspended for 15 days.
3. Then my video from youtube was removed for CopyRight infringements, whereas the video was of a balloon only. This is that video: [LINK](https://twitter.com/whiteHatSnr/status/1304298709916639232).
4. Then two of my Reddit accounts got permanently suspended, one for 'Harassment'.
5. Now all the 5 videos from my video got removed from YouTube for copyright infringements. How can I comment about WhiteHatJr and Byjus without even mentioning their names?

Byjus is not just a shrewd businessman he is running an evil corporation that neither cares about the mental health of students nor about their own employers. This kind of blanket ban on speaking against one person! Is this North Korea or what?

I have been making accounts after accounts and yet nothing can be said about him. Imagine how many lakhs of voices must have been crushed by his evil corp by now. The entire quora about Byjus and WhiteHatJr is filled with manipulations and fake reviews from fake profiles, each fake profile is from IIT, IIM, AIIMS, or an expert in AI, ML, or CEO of some BS. He is selling tags for years and none of the authorities noticed it.

(Whatever I have been saying since these couple of weeks, I provided proofs for that, and for this next thing I have no proofs as of now. But I have a STRONG feeling that his claims of him being IIM 100%tile topper twice at age of 18 and 20 when he gave the exams 'just like that' is also a FAKE BS Claim.)

This Byjus guy is just like Arindam Chaudhuri, that scammer IIPM guy. Every single thing about this Byjus company is fake. Their reviews on google play store (the video of which I had posted and they got it removed), their quora reviews from fake IDs, their claims of their 'extraordinary' products, their claims that their teachers are the top 0.01% teachers, their number of students who cleared IITJEE, NEET, CAT or UPSC exams (tbh they don't even declare these numbers clearly). Every single thing is a BIG lie.

Just yesterday Byjus acquired this BS company:

[https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/startups/byjus-acquires-virtual-simulations-startup-labinapp/78170388](https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/startups/byjus-acquires-virtual-simulations-startup-labinapp/78170388)

And look at this 5-year-old start up's app's stats: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.labinapp.sparkschool&hl=en\_IN](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.labinapp.sparkschool&hl=en_IN)

(1.8 ratings, 78 reviews, 5k downloads)

I am not a finance guy, but to me, this looks like he is doing some big-time scam with the money from his VCs. Not just that his product is bad, services are rude, their advertisements are immoral but there is something way shadier about this person.

I have a lot more proof about this company, there is a lot left to be shared.

Please follow [the youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJuE85w2kyFapd5_J9NDFPA) PLEASE (only one strike is left before the total ban).

I will post a video there sharing where will I be posting new videos from now onwards.

Also PLEASE connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/whiteHatSnr) so that if this Reddit account also goes away we have some mode of communication channel left between us.

BTW I have created our own subreddit r/WhiteHatSr.

Please support.",Now BYJUS got all the 5 videos from my youtube channel ALSO removed. If this isn't ONLINE BULLYING then what is?,Science/Technology," There's a good chance Byju's team will read this too. You can try this as a last resort. Document everything and post on Medium. If that gets removed, get your domain and post it there. It is very difficult for someone to bully into removing stuff from their website. But again, not impossible. If they get your website too, just don't go for morning walks. btw, have you appealed to reddit admins?

&#x200B;

EDIT: [https://www.reddit.com/appeals](https://www.reddit.com/appeals) This is crazy! 
Btw how can you get someone's account suspended on reddit. The report button only reaches out to mods. How did they even do this? Don't keep your name similar to whitehat_jr. You have changed just 1 letter. So basically they can easily convince anyone that you are trying to mimic them and bring bad name to their brand name. This simple reason is enough to file dmca and take down any content. 

Use a different name and add whistleblower to it. Be unique .  the id or name has to differ drastically from the brand name. How does whitehat_whistleblower sound like? 

I think you should create your own website and host your content and criticism and videos and host it on servers which do not comply to dmca. These servers are hosted in countries(Netherland, Singapore) which give a big fuk-you to those dmca notices. Google them, there are quite a lot. Wow... I have been following your previous posts. I must say these BYJU guys are vultures. They have a big PR team and too much money with an immortal company. Tldr?

Ps- fk byjus Upload it on PornHub for safekeeping Jeez dude stop posting your actual name on social media. That's a dumb thing to do. Also stop using a username that will get you suspended. Stick to facts and document everything logically and I am quite sure you won't be as easily banned. Hey, 

I posted this comments last time you made this post.

""I   am not getting into specifics of  whether BYJU's or Whitehat junior is   right or wrong. I am just posting  a mistake OP of the thread in Randia   made.

He  used the logo and name of   company who had it trademarked and now is  crying that,   youtube/platforms have removed it and how it is against  his freedom of   expression.

He  could have made a   youtube channel with any other name/logo and given  in tags what the   issue was about. Instead, what he did is trademark  violation. Wheter   Byju's or Whitehat did the same for other people is  irrelevant. It is   the onus on who owns the trademark to make the case.

Do  you expect me to start a youtube/internet domain/instagram id named, '    Microsoft Kerala Official', or ' Google Kerala' and all while having    original logo and not expect to be tried for trademark infringement?

Whatever  your case was, nothing will stick now as it was a clear cut case of    copyright infringement. That's how the law works. You might   agree/disagree, but what the OP did was pure idiotic.""

This guy has again made the very same mistake. He accuses BYJU's of copyright violation while doing the same thing himself.

**More importantly he has claimed he will use multiple accounts if he is banned in reddit. This is a violation ToS of Reddit. You cannot make   sock puppet accounts to override a ban.    ""**

You got banned from Reddit for creating sock puppet accounts to evade a ban. Creating accounts and joining Reddit again after you have been banned, is a violation of Reddit ToS. 

It has nothing to do with r/India, Byju's or Whitehat Jr. 

&#x200B;

Your account on reddit is again going to be banned, because you posted in your last post that you will create as many new accounts as you wish if you get deleted. Plus in this post you have agreed that you are the person behind the posts that got banned. Reddit Admins will block you if not r/India mods. I am a mod of a sub with significant traffic. If I allow a person to use multiple accounts to evade ban on Reddit, I will get a warning from admins of Reddit. Op. I know you're fighting the good fight trying to expose BYJUs and trying to make people wary about BYJUs schemes but BYJU and WhitehatJr are within their rights to have your accounts removed when u try to blemish their bussiness by fake personification. 

If you really wanna shake them, you gotta have a legitimate approach. I wish you well I mentioned it in the previous thread and got downvoted. I'll mention it again, your channel name is deceptive as per YouTube's rules. If the brand wants to go after you, there's not much you can do apart from raising a complaint with YouTube, and if that doesn't work out, seeking legal recourse against both BYJUS (I dislike them a lot too) and YouTube."
m9laeq,,One rupee coin from 1888 that has Victoria Empress picture on the back .,History ," fun fact : this one rupee coin is more expensive than
2000 rupees note The text on my new 20rs coin already looks more faded than this. I have that one too . My coin is similar to this one but its from 1907 if i remember correctly.

Correction:- My one rupee coin have King Edward the VII^th and is from 1905 Now make an NFT of the pic and it’ll be worth... A few Million Dollars! /s I have one from 1805, iirc there was some king's picture on it hey wait,I've got the same from 1862. I'll share over here. It's a quarter anna, not a rupee tho i think this coin is made of silver I also have one from the same year, but it was made of copper or some brown metal mix. Reminds us of divide and conquer. Let us all learn from the past, never forget the history(good or bad). What a beautiful coin. Its in my wish list. Have George V and VI one rupee coins, but not one from the Victorian era. Good find :)Edit: Does anyone know of an active subreddit dedicated to Indian coins and notes? Thanks Modern rupee as currency is very different from rupees of the past and only similar by name. It is also a relatively young experiment like most other major currencies. India stopped pegging it's currency to others only ~30 years ago. And it stopped being backed by any asset after Dollar became a fiat currency ~50 years ago (1971). (Before that all currencies were backed by gold)

Now all currencies are backed by nothing and the governments are all printing money and racking up debt. And we are in one wild rollercoaster ride. One fine day the world is going to get up and realise these currencies have no real value and each government can make up any value they want and that'll be the end of the this short experiment (relatively short in terms of human history). Do you know what's the failure rate of fiat currencies in the past? 100%."
k05d2v,,Coffeezilla covers the WhiteHat Junior Situation .,Business/Finance," For a company that pretends to know everything about computing they definitely forgot about one of the most important rules of the internet, you try to Silence something on the internet you are only promoting it More like AssHat but ok. For Context

As this is gone on r/all here's a tldr:

There's this new company in India that aims to teach coding to children aged around 8. They advertise about multiple 8 year olds getting 1mil+ jobs and opening startups all over media.  

Moreover the teachers employed dont know even the very basics of programming and put the kid through very base and harsh environment leading to children being visibly affected, so parents by their right ask for this to be resolved and/or be refunded. But there has been a clear lack of proper resolution or even response from the company.   


They have actively removed any bad feedback from playstore reviews, and gotten multiple people banned over other social media platforms for raising their voice and asking for refunds. The indian courts asked them to remove 1-2 of their ads but the underlying scheme of making money remains the same.


Infact a massive amount of fake bought out reviews can be seen all over the internet. With different forms of mass marketing, the parents are still getting fooled in huge numbers. And all the negative noise is being buried under the ground. 


The OP ( u/pooniahigh ) has been actively collecting proof and raising his voice since many months now. But most news media have refused to take up the story. Finally after very long OP found out about their open slack channels, because these guys never knew about password protecting their internal slack systems. After months of abusing the OP and trying to bury his voice they have now raised a legal defamation case of 2.6mil against him. And he is ready to fight. The only hope now is probably international media and or financial support and guidance from more knowledgeable folks. I hope we are able to remove the greedy wolves that want to burn childrens futures for money from our present and set a precedent for other similar companies trying to do the same.

1. The company has a relentless, guilt tripping tele sales team that feeds on parent insecurities and forcing them to subscribe
2. A typical ad will read like this: ‘9 year old Wolf Gupta is making 2 million a year from Google. Don’t let your children left behind’. Or ‘12 year old Wolf Gupta has a job offer from Google with a 2 million a year salary. Teach your children programming today’
3. The company’s course teach children to make basic apps by dragging and dropping blocks. It is not a bad way to introduce programming and build interest among children.
4. The company has been recently acquired by a billion dollar startup in which Facebook is a big investor

Also , Wolf Gupta is not real ~~It can't hurt you~~ not is Ryan Venkat . They are all made up fictional characters that are used in marketing campaigns and company implied were real . However , They admit that they are fictional in the Lawsuit .

Edit : Updated the Summary thanks to fellow redditors More of Chintu ne fake app baya 😂 I been seeing a lot of this Karan Bajaj’s posts on LinkedIn acting like some persecuted Silicon Valley genius. He’s getting dragged through the mud and he keeps deleting the comments. I’m here to watch this fraud go down. [Please refer here for updates](https://twitter.com/LiveLawIndia/status/1330743096531795969?s=19) I have a friend who works with WhitehateJr  and wanted me to join as a Team Manager or a teacher. And I’m like I know nothing about coding because my strength is people management. She goes, “You don’t need to know coding. We have books and you just go through it and explain. “ so yeaaahhhh. I’m glad to see someone do something about it. I saw it .

Laughed when he said Wolf Gupta was murdered or something like that . Ah, the Streisand Effect.


Pradeep Poonia would have been an obscure crusader, had it not been for the very public court case. Can they even take this video down ? Then it will be an international matter right ? Imagine this hypothetical situation where the Court asks BlackCapSr to produce Wolf Gupta in front of court and their lawyer states that Wolf has defected to Burma under self-imposed exile for personal security."
j5lpp7,,River crossing problem,Politics," I got the answer 

step 1: first the girl should cross the river and get as far away as possible from those assholes... End Step 1 - Get Plate
Step 2 - Bang
Step 3 - Get Diyas
Step 4 - Light em up
Step 5 - ?????????????
Step 6 - Magically appear on the other side of the River. Answer: The police officer molests the woman. Woman cries foul. Media arrives. Woman is jailed. The Yogi blames Nehru for the pathetic infrastructure which lead to the molestation. Thakurs express support for the police officer. Yogi declares he will build the infra. Builds a tall statue. Woman rots in jail. Solution ; build a ram mandir and pray together Solution 1: Bring Modi, he will build a bridge and wave at the empty river. There won't be need of any boat.

Solution 2: Bring padmashee Kangna. She will yell at both Modi and pandu.

Solution 3: Bring mamata from TMC, she will kill yogi. they all should take the boat and as soon as police or neeta aboard girl should kick them off to river and tell everyone that there was no river. History had taught me, burn the girl, suspend the cop, initiate a CBI probe. they will also say there's no citizen. Citizen takes the boat and crosses over alone. Cop and politician say there's no river anyway; they can walk across. This must be the international plan to defame yogi. Just demolish the river and make a BhAvYa RaM MaNdIr."
kbtsy5,,An ideal farmer,Politics," The ""sleep on time"" bit hit me hard Media called them from unjust to terrorists some days back. they've flipped from that now and saying that their protest is hijacked by terrorists linking it to flop CAA protest(simply because someone came and stuck an anti-national poster around farmers. Who knows if it's done by bjpee supporters to degrade the protest.)  


Those are our elders and feeding hands sitting in the middle of winter in cold open. They deserve all kinds of comforts and luxury. **Imagine if your grandfather or your father or uncle was there. Wouldn't you want them to rest and be comfortable?**

Yesterday I was watching some random union leader speaking about the ills of the farm laws and how the last night rain dismantled their tents and surrounded was a very old farmer. It's struck me and instantly he reminded me of my grandfather. My grandma at that age was dependent on us for a lot of things and here a farmer is fighting for the next generations to come to avoid becoming slaves of corporates. Freakin dark man!

Bhakts will now express their desires to boycott her OF. Not like they could buy the subscription. It's shameful that foreign celebrities are trying to bring attention to this issue and in return indian celebrities on  twitter are talking about unity.
The level of cringe is hilarious and sachin tweeting what he did of all people is just disappointing beyond belief. But why sarcastic tweets. Someone tell her. Here people don't have brains. They don't even know what is logical or not. Their small brains can't understand sarcasm. I can't believe the soft-porn cringe comedy vine star Amanda Cerny has more brains than the majority of the people I know. I never thought I'd be on the same page with her. Is our imagination so limited that even when we are making up shit, we can only think in the lines of 'send noodes'? Who knew I'd find Amanda Cerny funny. Guess she has a new Twitter follower. Bhakts have zero respect for women, their dignity, and their agency to make their own decisions. That is why they go so low while attacking them. ""How dare this woman open her mouth?

nd21va,,The Waves,Politics," Can't even imagine if India elects Bisht as PM in near future somehow!! That would be a sign of apocalypse!! Why is that Fanta bottle thought of as a ""good PM candidate""? He is uncharismatic as hell and his very presentation is bound to piss someone off.

Dude is a cheap knock-off of his boss. YogiG makes ModiG look like Vajpayee If Yogi is elected then that's it. Game over! I don't think that there will be much difference between us and North Korea. This guy is 100x more egoistic, authoritarian, communalist and uncontrolled than Gobhiji. Let's hope congress changes its leadership as well so there is no path for people like him to enter our political scene. What's wrong with atal? I am not old enough to remember his policies. Abki Baar, Antim Sanskaar! Next election, when Pisht comes to beg for vote, he may face music for the corona genocide in UP. The fourth wave - Communal Virus. Get well soon, Modia. Poor Advani, He was sidelined like some highschool ex boyfriend! These are all mini bosses. Tejasvi surya is the main boss. Idk dude. I can understand our frustration and anger over the current government and also of Advani. But Vajpayee? I've read about him and policies he adopted during his rule. I usually put him third after Nehru and PVN on my ranking of PMs. Any reason why you think we 'barely' survived his administration?"

EDIT:- Forgot to mention their son, Mrinal Miri, who is a University of Cambridge graduate, an MP currently and a recipient of the Padma Bhushan award. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrinal_Miri Kudos to your grand-uncle. Kaziranga is a fantastic place and it is all due to his efforts. Glad to have learnt something new today. Your grand uncle has a legacy that will last for generations to come. This is some serious shit bro. 
I have always looked up to Kaziranga, that park single handledly brought back great one horned indian rhino population.

Indian rhino population plummeted to just 200 in start of 1900, now its back and stable at almost 3000 individuals. Probably one of the largest in the world.

Its a shining mark for India as a whole. Celebrities come and preach to look how Kaziranga is a beacon of hope. Homage from a fellow indian to your great grand - uncle. 

Im sure he doesn’t know the difference he made. Wow..Cool heritage man. King Now that's an unsung hero worth mentioning 📣 Hats off to this legend. Handsome af. Ayy good to here from a fellow Assamese Dhuniya 🙂"

Republic TV was already a sinking ship, most journalists are leaving the place along with a toxic work culture. The only thing that keeps the place running is BJP's indirect support and funding. 

I was already suspicious of BARC's data for some time. Always suspected the 'super high' ratings that Republic TV used to enjoy. Wouldn't be surprised if there is a whole racket going on behind BARC's back.

Does anyone on this sub have Barometers installed in their homes by BARC ? Band kardo bhai sab.

NDTV as well. Of all the political parties, only Shiv Sena has spine to speak to BJP in their own language.

Could be a cultural block, but on special days like Fourth of July we light fire works similar to Diwali. I guess I never considered the environmental impact of fireworks, but is that where Indians take issue to fire crackers. Can someone explain this controversy to me? Is there an issue with fire crackers because of the environment? Maybe pets getting scared? Just wanted a bit more explanation from people who live there or know more.

https://twitter.com/jazzyb/status/1358554697716490241

Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xLtwq3FZ04

The ad included a clip of Jerry Dyer, Mayor of Fresno city, agriculture capital of California saying ""We stand with you, as you stand against the unfair government interference against all of you"". Tomorrow we're gonna see tweets about how khalistani farmers paid 50 million for the Superbowl ads. Another example of the Streisand effect which our govt cant fucking understand Now Bhakt Ch0des will boycott Association Football instead of American Football ""super bowl is anti-india conspiracy!"" Top searches today-
'Is California in Pakistan?'
'Is CBS funded by Khalistanis?'
'Are the Tampa Bay Buccaneers owned by Rihanna?'
'Is Tom Brady a Muslim?' Waiting for B grade celebraties to start tweeting against NFL now. Tommy chu... I agree that this protest should gain more attention but I am not a huge fan of this. Not only will it kind of ""dilute"" the situation and might sway the international perception off the real issues, but it will also give the govt another chance to pull something out of nothing to defame these guys.

It is India's greatest misfortune during this pandemic. India's numbers might have been far different if someone else ~~more~~ competent occupied his position. All that difference should be directly attributable to him and he should be held accountable accordingly. IMA: We dare you to file complaint against Ramdev


Govt : Complaint will be filed against IMA for discrediting Ramdev and questioning Govt. Nothing will happen. The health minister himself went to launch 'Coronil' for ramdev. That just shows the kind of influence and following that ramdev has. Let's call him by his real name please.

Ram Kisan Yadav IMA should cancel health minister's medical registration Dad's a doctor and the anger in the doctor's association is palpable. I think this will hit Ramdev and BJP hard. 

This time the public sentiment is also against Ramdev My father is also a doctor and part of IMA ofc. And he really hates all the bullshit told by yogi Baba and ram dev. To be honest neither gau mutra or yoga can save u from covid. Last year whole colony got covid cuz they decided they will do yoga in group. So yeah ram Dev must apologize. I'm surprised to see the IMA calling themselves as 'allopathy'. Atleast using the term within air quotes would have been nice. The term 'allopathy' was coined by the homeopaths and other pseudoscientific quacks promoting snake oil medicines to undermine the modern medicine for their personal gains. IMA and other doctor/ medical association has written over 100 scathing letters in the last 12 months but Fuckvardhan has given absolutely ZERO fucks. They've tried with logic, satire, plead and threat but for this government gau science > actual science and PR > actually supporting frontliners. Waiting for the Health Minister to go and fall at Ramdev's feet to apologise for this letter."

I saw a few blue tick handles on twitter that I follow tweeting/retweeting about this - it was surreal! This game got featured in multiple news outlets and I even gave interviews to a couple of them using my reddit alias! 

It got more than 1.3 million page hits in just a week. (I've almost exhausted my bandwidth for my entire hosting account, I don't know how long can I keep this up without burning a hole in my pocket - let's see)

All thanks to this sub. Your comments have been so nice! I'm going to re-read them when I am feeling low. It's been very overwhelming. Thank you!

Hoping to gain something out of this virality and since I am still keeping my identity a bit discreet in case things go sideways - i created a new twitter handle [@u_maxmess](https://twitter.com/u_maxmess) so that hopefully my future projects get a better reach. I hope you can follow it and give credit to it for the website. Thanks

Since your game is JS, minify that code and save considerable bandwidth. There are also free CDNs like cdnjs or GitHub which can serve that JS file instead of you hosting it directly on your server. Monetize it some how. You're the man OP. I put the page on my friends group with 90% bhakts and positive results have started to come in. I'm no longer friends with more than 50% of them.

I would like to thank you for coming up with such an innovative concept. No doubt, it was an instant hit. Every time someone would forward the link to me via whatsapp I would brag to them that he is a fellow redditor and I was one of the first person to click the link.

You made us proud. Thanks to you for garnering the courage to do this gutsy thing. Just host the site in Github pages and you will have unlimited bandwidth.

mb4e9i,,Trimax Gold. The iPhone of all pens. Owners of this pen had a different swag in my school.,Non-Political," A senior once wanted to borrow my tennis ball in games period and give his trimax gold as collateral. good ol days Me gareeb, happy with natraj 5 rupee ball pen. Won many pen fights as well. I have a love/hate relationship with this pen.

Couldn't play penfight with it as it was too costly and then loved how smooth it was while writing. But I absolutely hated the fact that it leaked at a slightest mishandling The king lost its charm when Reynolds turned into Rorito I guess. But yes this shall belong to the hall of fame once retired. Love how this is flaired as Culture & Heritage 🔥 This has to be *the* most stolen pen in the history of pens. I never owned one more than 4 months while in school. Especially the special edition ones. Now that school is over, I'm finally owning one for about 3 years. Absolute bliss. Paired with the  Classmate notebooks, this was the ultimate status symbol. I'm sorry the iPhone of pens would be Parker, Sheaffer, Mont Blanc etc. Dgp's son had this pen in our class; it was from then on considered as a symbol of power and authority. good luck when it leaks I got a funny story to tell. My dad worked in a publishing company, so once when I was in 5th standard, his company ordered few thousands of custom parker pens to be used for presentations and teacher-orientation meetings. So, each employee got four boxes filled with parker pens and each box had like 50 pens inside it. So, when my dad got the boxes, he just gave away the boxes as in practice, no one takes a box filled with pens to orientation meetings. So, I convinced my dad to give me a box and then I became the prowd owner of 50 parker pens, and like a fkin NGO, I gave away  like 40 of them to my classmates. So, for a period of two months, everyone in a section 5 H owned a parker, all thanks to me and I became a god. The World Heavyweight Champion of Pen Fight Tournament 💪💪"

Requiescat in pace, Freedom of Speech. Reminds one of Junior Spies from 1984. Kids who spied and led to death of their own father Mr. Parsons. If anyone has not read 1984 by Gorge Orwell, this is how your create suspicion and disloyalty among your friends and family. No one can be trusted and anyone can betray anyone.  If this gets implemented free speech in India would be dead considering that this govt considers anti national or sedition material. I am a part of a local BJP-RSS group of 200 people with 90% bhakt and I regularly post memes critical of Shah-Modi regime. Everyone knows me personally but hate me for speaking the truth. Think I will be screwed soon 😭 Nazi days coming to our country. Holy fuck. This is exactly what the Stasi used to do in East Germany. So many innocent people were dragged through the muck, broke apart families, societies. The primary currency of such a move is to make everyone suspect each other while the rulers enjoy power. I'm just so tired living here..

I love this country so much but I'm just exhausted..

Weren't the leaders supposed to be our representatives?

Ughhhh. I can't even bother anymore. This is turning into a police state by small sighted people.


Please don't report this. I'm not anti national, I just wish better for my country. We are better than this..

Tho... Historically, this is what has always been India's downfall. Betrayal and snitching. Lack of loyalty. This is the last nail in democracy's coffin

Under theses circumstances, when you can report anyone for anything, how do you think businesses and cooperation will work.

Trust is the base of every transaction, now we are putting neighbours against neighbours, friends against friends. Student against teachers, employees against bosses.

j30xw0,,This is why the Führer wins in India!,Politics," The truth is this - Left wing is simply a collection of people who do not subscribe to the right wing ideology for whatever reason.

For example, a jeans wearing Modi bhakt is a ""conservative"" whereas a conservative muslim who does not subscribe to the BJP hardliners is a ""liberal"".

There are people who may want Hindu-muslim unity, but won't marry their children to a dalit or another religion; You may scoff at the BJP's ancient gaumutra obsession but might be uncomfortable with the 21st century LGBT movement. All these people are clumped as liberals or secular or left wing for political purposes. 

In the absence of a RW, all these people might perhaps fight with one another. And that is exactly what happened in the political space before BJP came into the picture. Uniting against one wrong shouldn't be accepting all the other wrongs. Can confirm. One called me a staunch modi supporter when i dared to critisize Rahul Gandhi. 
I nether support nor vouch for either of them, all hail lord Cthalu . [removed] The one thing that irritates me is that people still follow outdated political spectrum like Right-left. How is this spectrum ideal if the only way you can ensure being progressive/moral/reasonable is by being a centrist.

This makes no sense. They have tangible, physical or important milestones to achieve, like elections, temples, etc. Ours is secularism, freedom, liberty. How do we achieve that? I am somebody who married intercaste without ever thinking about it, my family is pretty mixed, needless to say I am pretty much a progressive, perhaps I need to be more educated on caste issues - still have been called a Nazi, casteist out of the blue on Reddit! This is because we are all prejudiced. If you probe enough, people's prejudices will eventually come out. Just yesterday Anand Patwardhan wrote something on twitter about Babri demolition and faced backlash at the hands of online crusaders because it mentioned the word Sharia. The point I'm trying to make is that liberal values are very susceptible to being hijacked. 

One must be able to identify a problematic stance from a righteous one. Just because we stand on the opposite side of it, doesn't make our arguments superior by default. A lot of the arguments made by anti-bjp people are misinformed and further extension of their own prejudice. As a socialist, I really find it problematic seeing the kind of people being garlanded by the left. Most of whom are opportunists who have realised that identity and caste politics would make you rise quick and without much effort like a bubble in a lava lamp. How congress dreams of being back in power with RG at the helm is beyond me. We need a new opposition with a new face to take India forward and keep the ruling party in check, at the moment they can just about do anything because they know that the opposition is gonna field RG. I've got a random question. I'm an American with an Indian friend who's a big Modi supporter, even though he sides with liberal US politics and all his viewpoints seem liberal. He says it's complicated, and I don't press him on it. I think it's about anti corruption for him.

Are there lots of people like that in India? Because in the US, a liberal wouldn't be caught dead supporting Trump. Just have a good look at INC's twitter handle and you'll know why Modi is winning.

Fucking idiots in charge of the opposition. 5th grader fighting satan. Good luck I say."

k8g7n1,,"So I bought a made in India product, surprise surprise :-|",Business/Finance," We were at the last stage of the ordering process with a Chinese manufacturer and we had sent them the carton design. Then the Chinese lady asked me why is there no ‘Tiger’ on the carton. I didn’t understand what the hell she was talking about. Our branding has nothing to do with tigers, nor does our product. It was then she explained to me that almost all her Indian customers included a tiger logo on the carton design. The ‘tiger’ she mentioned turned out to be the ‘Make in India’ lion. 

I didn’t know if I should laugh or cry 😕 Just wanted to point out that the company which I would not like to name, is an Indian company, trying to act like a true deshbhakt. 

That's why they've written Designed in 'OUR' India. 

Who cares where it's manufactured right? /S Lol ...The Company ..Give us the name Sounds like a Micro aggressive attempt at reaping the Max benefit of faux-nationalism. A mobile phone company who had a recent resurgence, asking us to go ""Cheeni Kam"" has a big chunk of it's internal hardware 'Made in China'. Sad truth. They should have written, 

Made in India

PS: Manufacturing apni bas ki nhi hai Why use ""Our India"" promoting nationalism, designed in India would have be enough... 'our India'

> *Communism has entered the chat*

Why you Aunty  National !! Just blink twice if its micro(dick)max Designed in 'our' India... LOL...

my0ysz,,The New Indian Express on not covering IPL during the pandemic.,Sports," Finally somebody said it, it's crazy for news channels to jump from 20 people dying in a hospital everyday to ipl news in a situation like this. Wait a minute, **here's** your cute picture of Bollywood celebs babies and a dozen of articles about how Bollywood celebs are unable to party outside in this situation !!! Like the romans of the past who wanted __bread & circus__, we need __religion & cricket__. Yay. Now republic of will give more coverage and pthetic Bhadwas of RSS and BJP will praise MoFo Arnab again. Btw, still waiting to hear a sedition case on Arnab for knowing and leaking defense secrets. IPL is one of few things keeping me sane Listening to All India Radio be like:

""In India today, over 3 lakh new cases of covid were registered creating a world record. While the nations capital is hit the worst with the death toll now standing at 13 thousand."" ""Meanwhile, King Virat dedicated his 6000 runs in IPL to his wife.""

Yeah, I get that that's news from sports but one stems from a pandemic created by a megalomaniac's ignorance and the other a sport that can simply be ignored. But it's also a ray of hope for us. I am really exhausted and worried watching covid news every evening. With New Indian Express, I am sure the reclaimed space will be covered by ads. It will be ironic if they put up political ads with a pic of Dear leader claiming how well they are handling Covid crisis What difference does not covering IPL make. Just a PR stunt Still covered in [ their online edition.](https://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/ipl/news/2021/apr/25/shubman-gill-will-be-one-of-the-highest-run-scorers-by-end-of-ipl-says-david-hussey-2294598.html) I strongly disagree with this. First of all, there’s not much these cricketers could do to help out while playing this. More importantly, everyone is some form of depressed with what’s going on, at least there’s something to look forward to and help take peoples mind off and give a break. We deserve some form of break from all this."

l9ukia,,Adopted a slum in Gurgoan. Looking forward to a new school for these kids.,Non-Political," Proud of you op! OP, this is really impressive - Congratulations! The post caught my eye because I have been meaning to do something very similar, but couldn't get around to figuring out the specifics. Can you share some details on how someone can either start something similar or join the current effort? More specifically -

- What does 'adopting a slum' really mean? Does it mean you are sponsoring food and education for kids (and adults?) in the slums or is it more than that.

- What is the order of funding needed for say a slum of 1K kids? Are you able to easily meet the funding goals and what is the main way you are raising awareness?

- How about land acquisition for schools in often tightly packed slum localities?

I am happy to reach out in person, if this is sounding like a lot of info to share with a stranger. Thank you, any help is much appreciated. On one side there's news of rapes ......everyday. & then there's you. Thanks for for keeping humanity alive. tum bhout mast kam karta h bhai👏👏👏♥️ Can you provide some details? thanks man Can I DM you on Reddit, I have some ideas I want to share to help. How can we contribute? I also have a similar plan when I get a job, to atleast teach some poor kids. Isn't it by law mandatory for govt to educate every child of the country. Or are you talking about private school? Good on you OP! How can I/we help? 

If you are building a school which provides the nutritional, educational, and mental support kids need, then I am in. Volunteers are great but see if you can fund full-time good teachers.

I have volunteered at orphanages in India and the conditions are dismal. We are failing these kids. These kids are bright and capable but are scarred and the support just isn’t there. You hear their stories and it will scar you. Most orphans I worked with were abandoned by family and were torn between their hatred of their parents and missing their parents/siblings. Their hatred manifests in violent ways at how they look at the world. Whaat. That's really nice man."

I was not hoping this post to get this much traction. Thanks to all the kind strangers on the internet who gave me advice, made me feel belonged and awarded this post. It was nice spending my birthday evening talking to you all.

Story.

* I was raised by single mother and till date have no connection to my father or his family.
* Because of being a divorcee, my mother is not really well received in her family making her the only family I had, she was a only child too.
* Mothers death made me the last person living in my family.
* I tried to enter the arranged marriage market but was not well received due to being a son of a divorcee. Plus I had anxiety, am unattractive and some other personal issues.
* I'm thus now a 40 year ( as of 30-12-2020 ) old virgin, who gets lonely from time to time.

Edit 2

To those people who messaged me personally, I really appreciate your effort; but please don't. I am not good at talking to people, and I don't really need sex. I'm at a point where I'm not bothered if I get it or not. I have been however longing for companionship and forming a bond with someone on an intimate level. The probability of happening such is nearly zero.

Edit 3

I can't possibly reply to everyone. Thanks again for such kind words, compassion and birthday wishes. This is a really nice community/subreddit.

Quite a lot of people suggested to adopt a pet. I'll will definitely look into it and have always wanted to own one, my job had prevented me from doing so ( i have odd working hours; IT ) and now that I'm working from home I think I will be able to manage time to do so. As of now I feed the strays; both dogs and cats.

Wow. This pandemic couldn't have made things worse for you. 35/M here brother. I also suffer from similar anxiety. I come from very low economic background. By God's grace, I'm working in a MNC, my sister is also an engineer.  
My economic background, not handsome, orthodox upbringing all summed up and I'm single still.  


Sorry for candid comment, but couldn't resist commenting after I see your post as I could co-relate personally.  


Birthday Greetings and Best wishes to you that soon you find your partner. What superpowers have you unlocked?

15 more years, and I'll join the club 🍾 Holy fuck. I just went 28. Need to hurry. Just go bang some hookers man. Sex is overrated af but when you dont get it, it seems to be the most important thing. And if you are gonna give me some bullchit reply of having sex with someone you love etc etc then look at what waiting 40 years has brought. If you are in Delhi pm me I'll help you get laid but you gotta pay for it. I am not a middleman but wont mind helping you out.


Edit:  There goes my inbox. Sell everything go on world tour bro. You're free. Most of the people are not. Grass on other side is always green  It's real funny that a lot of people are suggesting being an 'improved version of yourself'. Going to the gym, grooming and so on. It's not bad advise, and I try to follow it too, but the thing about anxiety is that you aren't yourself when you are with others, and especially with a woman, and you are compensating for not being yourself when you are alone. The amount of time I have spent scratching my head trying to understand what's wrong with myself is just bizzare.

But mate, there has to be an opening somewhere, there always is. It's like being bundled up in a box made of the world, but somethings just click. For me it's watching films on my TV or in a theatre, reading philosophy (Zizek is my favourite), feeding stray dogs, watching comedy. Even the gym is starting to feel okay.

You probably have a much different struggle than I have. You are 50 after all. Or is it 40? Anyways the point is it doesn't matter. Once you start getting an opening in the wooden box made of the world, it just starts to open. Things will start to make sense. How can I get out of this box, but more importantly what is forcing me to stay in? Is it just mental gymnastics? Who knows, but let's find out.

One day you will snap out of it. Sir Isaac Newton. Nikola Tesla. Swami Vivekananda. Jesus Christ. They were all virgins till death. You're in good company pal ;) One true redditor Hey man. I somehow fear that in some years I may have the same achievement. I guess if you are feeling lonely try adopting a pet maybe? Heard that helps a lot. Or maybe travel around if you have your own vehicle. A lot of people are alone and rocking man. You can do it. Don't lose hope."
ljsb0k,,"Disha Ravi, 21 year-old climate activist, set up desk and invite people to challenge her about climate change.",Politics," But should not she write ""Climate change is real! Change my mind. Earlier it was TADA and POTA, now it's UAPA, NSA, and PSA. 

Interesting fact, the actual conviction rate under these laws since 2016 is around 2% only. The only reason they charge people with sedition is not to jail them for life, but to fill fear in the eyes of people who are watching and advocating these activist and journalist. Few months in jail and the work is done. It's about sending a message.

Watch Ravish prime time episode from last week about same. So I tried to collect more information regarding her arrest. 

Firstly, it's absolutely bizarre to think that a climate change activist would be linked to Sikh Separatists. She's not even a Sikh. Calling her a Khalistani makes zero sense and the people calling for her imprisonment should keep this in mind.

Very likely, her NGO (along with many others such as Extinction Rebellion) were helping Thunberg in sharing the toolkit. It's pretty likely that PJF (whose founder is accused of being a Khalistani sympathiser) had played a role in drafting of the toolkit, but there is zero evidence to suggest that Divya Ravi knew about the personal ideology of the PJF's founder. Many organizations and NGO's collaborate around the world for major protests and this was the case here. The only purpose of them collaborating was to raise awareness about the farm bills and make people aware of the future course of action (such as future protests). 

PJF's website doesn't talk anything about separatism and its campaign - AskIndiaWhy, was mentioned in both toolkits. The main reason why the toolkit was edited was because it was publicly accessible and people were freely editing it, in order to spread misinformation.

However, her NGO was also targeted, one year ago, by the Ministry of Environment, due to the NGO's disagreement over the Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2020. This led to the ministry sending a warning to her and also promising strict action against her organization. 

What happened to her today was extremely unfortunate and she deserves to be released as soon as possible. The toolkits did not attack the sovereignty of the nation and did not call for any violence, except peaceful protests outside Embassies, which isn't a crime. We are not talking about Iranian Students attacking US Embassy, but people sympathetic to the Indian Farmers, who just wanted to bring more spotlight to the issue. 

Simple as that.

Edit - You can check Twitter Account of Saket Gokhale to find information regarding the complaint by Ministry of Environment. 

Also, one Reddit user was asking for her public hanging on a similar post in this sub. I'm not kidding. People need to stop shouting for the hanging of a 21-year-old. She is not Ajmal Kasab. It's weird when brown people uses the meme of a racist like Stephen Crowder. World renown piece of shit. Although, Kudos to the climate change activist for putting herself out there and getting her message heard. Can someone explain to me what was wrong with the original toolkit shared by Greta? Also, is there something wrong with the new one she shared? Toolkits are like guidelines to a protest, right? Genuine question. Indians actually believe more in climate change as opposed to other countries. Where we are wrong is our belief that enough is being done to stave it off She's in jail rn She doesn't deserve what's happening to her. God bless her! She needs to be safe from the cruel Dalli police. Stand comedians and climate activists have a tough time in this country and its heartbreaking. O God! She set up a desk at a random state owned place. She's hurting India's sovereignty."

I will recommend you to visit South India and look at all the magnificent temples. They are so old yet so magnificent, full of crazy details, details which is even challenging for today's technology.

Visit Kailash Temple, the whole temple was carved out of a single rock. No sculpture or piece of this temple is placed afterwards, everything is carved out from a single mountain rock.

Visit Suchindram Gopuram, this structure is full of amazingly detailed sculptures. There are around 1Lakh sculptures (100 thousand)

Visit Hoysaleswara Temple, again you will find crazily detailed sculptures here. The sculptures are used to tell different stories from India's culture.

And India is full of magnificent places like this, especially South India.

Oh also, if you haven't visit Angkor Wat in Cambodia. World's largest temple. Miss you, Canada. I miss India too! seven wonders for world...But Indian it is First wonder...love u This made my day!!

For ex- Delhi- Mumbai Corridor , Up-  west bengal corridor, tamil Nadu- karnataka corridor. There are some very very big projects in this designated areas, also they attract people from other states to come and get employed here. 

Even if these 5-7 states contribute significantly to our direct tax collection , these states have huge inflow of migrants which help them increase their tax collections more than those states from which the migrants originate. Haryana - tworupeejpeoples [deleted] On side note after seeing this migrant crisis playing out. Till now what has been happening is that labour moves to the places where capital is, for example migrants going to Gujarat to work in textile mills and all sort of factories in search of job opportunities. It would be much better if instead of labour, the capital were to be the factor of production which moved. As in investment poured in populous states like UP and Bihar where there is abundance of labour but lack of capital. Of course the concerned govts of these capital deficient states will have to provide a stable and supportive regulatory environment as well as invest in infrastructure and all such that businesses can come there and invest. I think the whole thing needs to be re-thought and some serious work needs to be done if the plight of this sort as playing out today is to be avoided in future and situation is to be improved. This new arrangement where capital moves to the place where labour is and not other way around as of now can be much advantageous in my opinion, if done right. [removed] Very surprised to not see Punjab here! I think most most companies file their taxes in the location of their HQ. Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore combined  probably pays more than the whole of India"

If we had a media this image would have ended up in every news paper and TV debate. But unfortunately we have lap dogs guarding a termite ridden chair called government. Look at him indulging in luxurious cheeseless pizza. Man this picture is heartbreaking Poor farmers. They feed whole country and barely have themselves to eat.

We should respect farmers and soldiers. They are our real heroes. Let's fight for their rights, so farmers live happily. I don't think this man is the bicholiya Happy new year everyone. Seek the truth and it will set us free. Satyamev Jaytè. Nothing wrong with hope.

Best of luck. The year seems to have had a good start, per me. Let us see how January turns out. I hope it is WILD. Someone publish this in a newspaper or an article (obvi supporting farmer's article should be ) Happy New Year!!! Here's hoping we learn from the past years ! Happy new year ! Let us stop giving attention to so called celebrities who does nothing but takes from us everything. Farmers on the other hand gives us everything and take nothing from us. No one can question the contributions of farmers to our nation.

lnfd2m,,'Previous Government',Politics," Bhakts - Look mudi even criticizes himself. He is the best PM ever. I wonder how they sleep at night . Mudiverses Modi criticising modi The government has already cashed a lot on the record level low prices of crude oil. They have cashed in so much through surplus imports that now the global crude oil prices have begun to bounce back. Its really lazy politics at this point when its obvious that the government is trying to offset their pandemic losses by taxing fuel. And mark my words, they will continue to do so until forever because this is easy money. They might lower the prices a bit and say 'Oh, look its back to 80 now' But overall the strategy is to offset as much revenue loss until the global prices get to their pre-pandemic levels. After seeing this

One part of my mind said, ""Reality is often disappointing"", but the other part chuckled and said, ""This does put a smile on my face.""

The same media that was abusing him and called him a druggie, a homo and other defamatory things. NOW he has become their darling. 🤣🤣🤣🤣

And sad to see Karan doing this because everyone knows he doesn't have any skin in the game. He's only doing it to rehabilitate his image. 

Isi ko kehte hai behti ganga me hath dhona. Our entire democratic system needs a big reform. What a spineless piece of shit, he has enough money and clout but he had to bend over backwards and suck off Jay shah. Let's not divert our attention from Farmers Protest and Modi Government's fascist approach to subdue dissent, over this non issues... One issue at a time People, One issue! A few years ago, Modi stated in a rally that MMS was a spy with shady relations with Pakistan. Naturally INC was pissed and they were disrupting the Winter Session of the Parliament.    
   
Sachin, who almost never attends the parliament, decided that was the right time to show up and talk about some mundane sports related topic. Congress again disrupted the session demanding Modi to apologize. Media painted the act as INC insulting Sachin and soon the fiasco was over after Arun Jaitley apologized in Modi's behalf but Sachin never returned to the parliament to talk about the extremely important sports issue that had compelled him to show up in Delhi that day.   
   
Sachin is trash. Lol, this is cute. The guy played a professional sport and earned millions.  This is like when atrocities in Hong Kong were happening and they wanted to know LeBron James's stance on it.  He didn't say a word cause space jam is about to be the biggest movie in China when it comes out.  

Like any of these sports players, after a while they're a very fine tuned cog in a system.  They will never open up to their true belief system. [Sachin actually donated his Rajya Sabha salary](https://theceomagazine.com/business/coverstory/sachin-tendulkar-covid)

> As an honorary member of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India, he donated his entire salary of INR95 lakh (US$126,000) – which he was entitled to receive as a Rajya Sabha MP Post cricket Sachin has been absolutely useless. From squandering the opportunity of being in Rajya Sabha to shamelessly promoting/pimping the documentary about himself.  Didn't even give back to the sport that made him what he is by contributing in any meaningful way. 

And now after staying oblivious to protests/democracy everything, he participates in an organized tweet storm sucking up to the govt. This is the moment he decides to come out and take a stand.

Blame lies with me to consider him my childhood hero. He is just a cricketer with his own self serving interests after all."

I am doing my part to scam the scamsters, are you.??
/s People need to stop treating elections like films. Do not give a damn about the party spending crores on bigger rallies, start seeing through their lies they have been telling for years. Can't you see they're just pleasing you to secure your vote by influencing you anyhow?

Do not develop a favoritism to a single person or single party cause when you do that you're showing poor judgement as a citizen and that's not good for a democracy. Consider elections seriously and your vote valuable. See it as your moral duty as a proud citizen of the country.

You'll surely see there are no good leaders around, same goes for the world. Personally in such cases I'd either just not vote at all or I'd vote for the lesser devil to stop the giant ones. These parties think they can shift your opinion by making a bold impression on you with those bigger rallies, real question to ask yourself is what's their actual agenda for you - a common man?

Make your own opinion based on facts, then vote. Lastly, never ever vote for celebrities who come into politics purely for their own gain. Vote for such is a vote wasted and it only makes you look dumb, no offense."

n8josz,,When the prime minister actually had the guts to follow the protocol of a democratic country and take questions from Press. Modi is indeed a coward.,Politics," Gosh! This feels like a different life now. Good old time when a person accused of being mute, did actually speak up and shouldered the responsibilities.

Here we are now, helplessly looking at the country in self destruction mode.

Boils down to one question, is there a way to end this all before 2024?
The wait is too long already. Also,most importantly , Manmohan used to take with him group of journos with him and have press conferences on the flight whenever he goes on a foreign tour. Modi stopped doing that . This coward literally travels alone and journos have to make seperate arrangement now. Are you saying modi is spineless coward and a retard who would get caught and shamed if he opens his mouth during a debate/press meet??? Well who in right mind would suggest otherwise Back in 2014 I used to have long heated debates at the college mess with my then friends regarding Modi. I told them Modi would be disastrous if made PM, I forwarded articles about the 2002 riots, I told them the so called 'Gujarat Model' was a deception, I showed them the infamous Karan Thapar interview, I told them that the facebook pages like 'The frustrated Indian' 'Shanknaad' etc are just propaganda pieces to manipulate people but they didn't listen to any of this, they simply didn't care. Kept telling me shit like *'you don't know anything, you can't understand this'*

In 2019 I once again told them to not vote on the basis of a fucking movie, but again they didn't listen. Hell, I have had endless debates in this very sub with so called centrists who keep preaching *if not Modi then who*. 

I sincerely hope, for the sake of all our future, that when 2024 comes there won't be a need for these debates. Modi doesn’t respect the office of PM, doesn’t respect the constitution, doesn’t care for democratic ideals.

He’s our PM. He works *for* us. He is answerable to us. He doesn’t get that.. he acts like a feudal lord.

It’s akin to taking up a job and refusing to attend meetings with one’s boss. We called him Maun (mute) Singh back then. What did we know. I wish we had a daily press briefing culture, like the US. It's such a powerful symbol of democracy - the President's office being accountable to the public on a daily basis. They may still do horrible things, but at the end of the say are atleast answerable to questions from the press (indirectly public). Ironic how he was called ""Maunmohan"". Contrast this with the press conference modi had where amit shah answerd all the questions and he just sat there staring. If he ever does develop the courage to call a press conference which is highly unlikely, the only answers I expect from him are:
""Yeh sawal aap congress puchiye, aap congressi media vale ho kya?"" Or ""Bakki sab theek hai, Bas dosti bani rhe "" I used to think the UPA was a terrible government back then, i was jumping with joy when i saw Modi becoming the prime minister, till 2017 i was in a big delusion that Manmohan sir was a good for nothing, until i moved to mumbai, and our 300 iq prime minister brought  demonitisation. I certainly miss the old UPA days, when there was corruption, but we had a transparent government, who ensured that communal harmony was always a priority for India.

Even though it may not be possible, but we have to do our best to vote out this government."

At least. This very tweet by the IMA has like 50 likes on twitter, people don't care about what's happening with the medical sector. The recent reformation brought in by the BJP government in the health sector is just as bad as the Farm Bills but nobody apart from a few people care about it.

There were strikes and everything before they passed the NMC bill but none of it was covered by the media and even when they did they did it in a condescending manner by portraying the Doctors as entitled.

They are going to allow quacks to practice modern medicine by giving them ""bridge courses"", allowing quacks to do surgery, promoting pseudoscience over actual science, wasting money on gaumutra research instead of using it to improve the State Healthcare facilities. Everyone should be extremely worried about all these changes, they affect the common man just as much if not more than they affect the Doctors.

Literally in a few years except for the big corporate hospitals everywhere else will be filled with quacks prescribing modern medicine to patients and doing surgeries on them. Government hospitals will be filled by them, they will be running small clinics in your towns posing as Doctors, they will be hired in private hospitals because their salary would be cheaper. People won't have a choice other than to be treated by these quacks.

You would assume that after a pandemic people would appreciate and want to improve the Healthcare Sector of their countries but in our country we are destroying the Healthcare Sector and going primitive. God help us all. Activists are anti national, left are anti national, farmers are anti national, hindus are anti national, muslims are anti national & now doctors are anti national. 

Waiting for your turn? #VoteThemOut BJP polititians should exclusively get patanjali meds. No other modern medicine should be given to them...cause modern medicine is terrorism Next objective: plant RSS agents in Indian medical association. Doctor bhi anti-national? Engineer to pehle se anti-national the. Ye saare padhe likhe log deshdrohi ho gae hain. Sarkar ka paise se padhte hain fir sarkar ki hi burai karte hain. 

Aise doctors se ilaz karwane se to desh hit me mar jana achha hai (lol, said no one) 


Fir bhi main apne baccho ko achhe se acche school me padhaunga. Aur Doctor ya engineer hi banaunge. All institutions in India are under attack by these religious BJP sanghi nutjobs. Bold ass statement by IMA . Nut jobs might infiltrate it I'm afraid now 🤦‍♀️.

Chillin around without mask no social distancing it was terrible Great edit, but don't remove the signage of the original creator, srGrafo, at the bottom.

Removing the signage makes it disingenuous af. This looks a lot like a u/SrGrafo comic. Even meeting friends socially distanced is a scam. All of them are being so careless, removing masks as soon as we meet, hugging etc. I would've hoped our age group would know better. They would make me out to be someone paranoid about distancing and say ""zyaada mat Kar"" and all. I have a feeling telling people no is making them take offence even though the reason is nothing personal. Or, you know, just stay home. Oh my GODS don't get me started. The people in my society are SO fucking dumb. Navratri is going on, yay. Wanna gather and celebrate, um sure go ahead I guess but WEAR A FUCKING MASK. No one did.

Yesterday i got a notification from myntra saying 80% off, i checked and to my surprise it was having some of the same items i ordered, i called their customer support and they said to cancel and reorder. Guess what I saved 500 more now, lol. Cheap tricks... These people earlier added fair usage policy which makes them charge 150  delivery charges, which drove me off and now this looks like it'll be the last nail to the coffin Many times I find the same outfits cheaper on flipkart than myntra.

I think myntra wants to reduce its customer base, so they are resorting to this. Waiting for Amazon to come up with a fashion platform like Myntra. Hope that happens soon.

This is the difference b/w Amazon and Flipkart. Myntra customer service is shit. Don't even try. Lenskart does that too. Every e-tailer except amazon and flipkart do that Myntra's maths is absurd like

k88tbh,,Real Locusts!!,Politics," These cartoonists are getting damn creative! Kinda funny how Ornob chutswami called Locusts Pakistani Terrorists harassing Indian Farmers.... [Source](https://twitter.com/mirsuhail/status/1335744198918680577?s=19) People thought I lost my marbles when I burst out laughing while watching the news about the locust swarms..
I mean.. Tiddies... Why didn't we all stopped watching those filthy TV media channels already? They should be in Orange The popular news outlets, in all their blatant outrage and accusations against the farmers, cannot perhaps digest the fact that Indian farmers can speak English, that they can make their grievances a popular political matter and get support from their fellow countrymen. How they don't understand the arrogance of the ""illiterate-farmer"" stereotype is beyond me. 

What's more baffling is how openly the popular media displays such arrogance on a daily basis, without any hint of a working conscience. So true. If our national media was slightly careful than these protests would have been just farmers protesting against government not a religion war, which it is still not. Damn, this is so on point. Bloody media is the poison to everyone’s mind. 

Instead of being an eye opener and a medium to transparently guide us through the workings of our government, it’s inciting unsolicited violence & hate. 

Creating a chaos. 
Making it more difficult for people to know what’s right and what’s wrong. 
Spineless pests.

How long before Supreme Court takes it suo motu and then gives a clean chit to the ECI?

Make betting legal and give an an odds on this Finally somebody said it. Here in UP, evenly remotely reachable and previously untouched by covid villages are getting infected be sure of stupid ass panchayat elections. Day in and day out we are hearing stories of people going for election duty and trainings and finding themselves on deathbed in next weeks. You want to know the extent of criminality the state election commission indulges in - it is threatening people of FIR if they try to abstain from election duties because no matter what personal reason. There is absolutely no guideline in UP that comorbid, really old and vulnerable people could abstain from this man made covid party exercise and everyone is threatened of FIR if they don't join in. I have relatives, comorbid and old going on these duties and their families are shit scared. So yeah fuck election commission put these bastards in jail. Justice Banerjee, who made this observation, has been one of the sharpest judges of the Calcutta HC in the recent years. He should have been in the SC by now. But his career has been stalled because his father had headed the Railway Ministry constituted Inquiry Commission which had concluded that the forensics did not support the official version on the Godhra incident. 

While UC Banerjee Commission was disbanded by the SC on jurisdictional grounds, this [article](https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/15-years-after-the-godhra-we-still-don-t-know-who-lit-the-fire/story-vkeZowN2nhvVkAJPZAPntN.html) by Mohan Guruswamy tells us:

"" The FSL had also demonstrated by experiments that it was virtually impossible to throw inflammable liquids into the train through the open windows that are at a height of seven feet from the ground. The report also states that there was a three feet high mound running parallel to the track at a distance of 14 feet and if the fire bombers were standing on this mound and sloshing the fuel at the compartment only about 10-15% of the fuel would have got inside. Since the rest of the fuel would then have fallen outside there would have been burn damage on and near the track. This was not so. ...

 what is perhaps closest to the truth is the truly damning report of Mohinder Singh Dahiya, then assistant director of the Forensic Studies Laboratory (FSL) at Gandhinagar, Gujarat, which put paid to the theory of the coach being set afire by an angry mob, which had mysteriously collected outside the Godhra railway station. The report concluded that the coach was set afire by someone “standing in the passage of the compartment near seat number 72, using a container with a wide opening about 60 litres of inflammable liquid has been poured and then a fire has been started in the bogie.”  "" Supreme court will save Godi Commission. There's some music to my ears This is a very good and progressive development. Top EC officials should be tried for all the murder charges of those who have died! there goes another good judges career But with compromised SC, will any of this matter? Damn. Finally someone using the power entrusted in them to good use."

lzjnze,,"Cleaning of an area in sector 7 and 8 dividing road, Delhi by Vrikshit Foundation. Fellow Indians please go out there and start cleaning your local area support clean India, green India and clean environment.",Non-Political," And if you cant take part in cleaning (due to other commitments or any reason) atleast  please dont litter. Vrikshit Foundation is doing excellent work. Kudos to them. Area near had garbage problem.... people used to throw garbage near electric transformer ....so some shopkeeper put banner ...and words were ""some son of bitch are throwing garbage here"" in hindi. Those neta guys on hoarding in first pic also got cleaned.... That's the real dirt. I know many Indians have been to foreign countries and have seen how clean those places are. Part of the reason that happens if because people are cooperating and understand the importance of keeping not only their home clean but their surroundings too. You will feel healthier. Try cleaning your surroundings or if not that, just try to stop people from littering if you see someone doing that. OP, please post pics of the volunteers also next time, will motivate people. One thing has always perplexed me. Every village I have been to were exceptionally clean. Whereas almost every major Indian city looks like a pigsty. Why? What general population should know is that, countries like Singapore, Japan and some European countries which we assume to be clean countries are partly clean because its actually a cleaned country; people be it workers or locals residing there take care of the place. Thats why it's clean, we can do it to, only if we stop shrugging and delete the not my problem mentality. Our community our problem,"" its always never I am Indian, its always we are Indians"" Cleanliness was one of the things I really loved about Japan when I visited there. I have seen a random person pickup an empty plastic bottle on the station which wasn't even theirs! More people need to show such dedication to our country ! True anti-nationals are these people who go about littering in our own country! Kudos to the foundation ! I hope more and more people strive towards this goal ! This is so pathetic. It is not the responsibility of individual citizens to clean their streets. It is the direct responsibility of the Govt to do so. Govt can: 

1. Pass Legislation setting manufacturing standards to control environmental damage by regulating the materials used in packaging. 
2. Discourage the manufacture of items that are single use only. 
3. Create a system of garbage collection and recycling
4. Issue fines to those companies that contribute the most to pollution

This area will be clean now, but in 5-7 years it will be dirty again, or some other area will be dirty. 

&#x200B;

The issue is not that people discard the waste, but that the waste is created at all. Taking off the political banner alone cleaned half the space, thank you Vrikshit Foundation for such a timeless effort"
j7t168,,"Few days back, they would not have thought of all this sudden love coming their way. More details in the comment. #BabaKaDhaba #DelhiPeople",Non-Political," I made a similar post requesting help for an aged roadside vendor near my home. He used to come and sit there since lockdown started, so possibly because of financial distress after lockdown. Never saw anyone stopping by and buying something from him, so casually made a post on twitter asking people to help him. The post didn't go viral as such but a couple of local meme pages picked it up and suddenly I started seeing at least 2-3 youngsters standing by his stall everyday for a week. I also once saw a girl handing him some packets of biscuits and other eatables. So after a few days I went up to him and asked how's his stall doing. He, visibly surprised and happy, said since last week suddenly many people have come, bought things from him and offered help. I can't express the satisfaction I felt. Credits: *Tricity People*

""I was married to her when I was 5 years old. She was 3. In those days- the Britishers or the outsiders would molest unmarried women. So, they'd get us married while we were kids!
Beta, there was no choice we had. I had to like her & she had to love me back. It is like a 'mohar', we were stamped for a lifetime for one another at the age of 5. Whoever it would have been, I would have loved. This is what marriage is for, to love & bond. 
In 1961, they officially handed over my wife to me. I was so happy. I picked her up in my arms & got her home. We both moved to to Delhi from UP at the age of 21, seeing an ocean of possibilities Delhi held for us!
We stayed across Yamuna & later on shifted here. I first started with a fruit stall. But as we aged & our kids matured, we decided to do better with our life. We opened 'Babe da dhaba'. 
But for years, the work was slow. I ran it for 30 years making ends meet. But yesterday when I sat at my stall, I saw queues of people from NGOs, actors, people who just came to meet me. It was so overwhelming. I used to dream this when I was 21. I saw my dream coming to life yesterday. God listens to you, beta. Not now, but may be at 30, 40,50 or even at my age-80. 
But one day whatever you had wished for, with honesty would come to life making you dream further. I want to live more. Much longer now, with my wife as my pillar smiling like this. She learnt quickly how to pose for the camera, I took some time!
But now we want to go to shop, have someone work for us like the rich people do & I will take her out for a 'chai' like our younger days!
This seems just the beginning.""

i1o63x,"After Salman ran over the homeless people, one died and the others were injured. During the incident, a constable Ravindra Patil who was appointed for protection was sitting beside Salman Khan in the car. Patil testified to court that Salman was drunk and was driving at high speed.

Post that it is said that Patil was mentally harassed by Salman's aides, the underworld and was also harassed by Mumbai police and his colleagues to change his statement. Further, Patil started skipping trials in this case. It is said that either Patil didn't show up to avoid harassment or he was kidnapped during the trials. He was dismissed from his job as well.

Finally court ordered to arrest Patil for skipping the trials. After being arrested and lodged in jail, police officials started treating him worse than the murder criminals. Once released from the prison, his family too disowned him.

He was homeless, became a beggar, his weight being reduced to 30 kilos and finally was admitted to the hospital suffering from TB. He succumbed to the disease ultimately. A 29 yr young constable suffered for 5 yrs and died a cruel death.

Salman is a cancer on India. source: https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/story-bodyguard-who-died-alone-saying-it-was-salman-behind-wheel Don't worry, according to his fans he has covered it up by laude ka farming, charities and running being human Why are police constables even appointed for protection of actors? If this is true, this is one more shield for my thought that salman should accidentally drown in his own blood. Murder, assault, hunting endangered species, and yet he's literally worshipped and supportrd by lakhs of people. A perfect example of what's wrong with our country. Thanks for sharing but you should also link the sources TV being the primary source of entertainment and news, People believe what they see and this has a huge influence in their lives.

Check out The F16s if you're into it! You mean the bollywood music industry...? Check out The Local Train. There songs + music is really good and some of the videos are also awesome !

If elections are lost next month they will become more cockey . An international conspiracy is hatched if the leaders are competitive, intelligent, and are actively facilitating the well-being of the citizens, all aiding the swift growth of the country, thus hurting the conspirators' dominance on the world level.   


Now, why on earth anyone would spend a penny or a drop of sweat to conspire against India whose current leaders themselves are killing India, slowly by a thousand cuts, just to enjoy unbridled power? The sad thing about this cartoon is that it made me laugh as I totally can imagine this happening. When you do not see the reality that you are neck deep into, that is when you have buried your head in the sand. this exponential rise in hatred and pseudo patriotism will led to inevitable destruction to restore stability or to prevent increase in entropy in society.

This is what happens when you start believing the myths that were created by you The point here is that these people have taken advantage of the utter stupidity of the people

In the West, someone like him would get laughed at. The mere idea/suggestion he has found the cure is a joke. Yet somehow the people of India continue to take him seriously. My personal greedy wish is that he hopefully actually found a cure (?) which would cause India to be praised all over the world.

But, at the same time; it is really stupid that Indians are believing him before it is medically approved for corona. ""Uncles"" I have talked to simply are blindly believing it to be true before there is evidence.

What I dont understand is ""wtf is the move"". The move is too bold and brave imo. If he has lied in his ""advertisements"" he would be nationally vilified for lying (hopefully) and sink his brand.

I think this boldness is what is fooling many people to believe that it MIGHT work. The art looks like a mix of babaji and ram rahim

Source:- His twitter timeline.",Coronavirus," Shows you how much effort he puts into his image building. Covid is state of mind. Papar khao.

A single unscripted question is sufficient to shake him from his Maybach glasses to his sandals, as evidenced by his poor handling of the Puducherry ko vannakam incident. What are you talking about? We don't have COVID in India now. I’m sick and tired of him, please can we go back to 2014 and undo this? Karuna visited India for 21 Days , One evening Karuna heard thunderous vessels banging ..that high pitched noise drove Karuna back to China .. Modi was caught on camera reading prescripted question and answers in an interview. Journalist interviewing him asked the exact same questions which were written on the paper Modi was holding. Modi is a walking advertisement board. I can understand why he wouldn’t want to face the media. I liken him to Sir Ben Kingsleys character in iron man 3. It is however incredible how he gets away with it. It is frustrating how he is allowed to get away from media scrutiny. He hasn’t had a grilling interview since that Karan thapar interview. The leader of the nation through all the demonetisation, Kashmir issue caa nrc issue. As much as I hate Donald trump atleast he comes forward and faces one v one interviews. I do not understand how he doesn’t have to come infront of the nation and answer genuine questions. It scares the living hell out of me. I just need the caller tune to stop telling me there's a new virus in town. This isn't a new phenomenon, is it?! He's built his cult around perception management.  
I wonder if he has such awesome people managing his image, why can't he get folks who can manage the country for him, would be a win-win for all, surely he's smart enough to understand this. For the first 2 months, when the novelty of covid was high, he rode on it. The lock down measures and the contrasting measures taken by America improved his image, along the the PR efforts of thalis and diyas. A time when anything could be said coz post analysis phase was far away. Undoubtedly the lock down was necessary, but it also helped distract people from the riots taking place before that. I remember the mood of the nation at that point of time, especially from December, such polarization. Covid obliterated any issues before it. Had things gone well, no doubt the graphs would be similar.
      As the days went by and cases increased, he simply looked away in another direction, and weirdly enough China, SSR issues came at an opportune time for godia to yet again deflect attention from covid this time.
     Some are saying the novelty trend of covid shows up here. That's for general public. Covid is a pandemic. It demands that leaders face it directly not approach it from a side. This may not be war, but it certainly is the highest magnitude of disease outbreak and requires them to reach out to public and solve or control the problem on the same level as a war. America is a diverse and polarized country with issues, just as any other country, and it's incredible how the leader is held accountable by media. And just as incredible that India's leader has given 1 press conference in past 6 years."

hudq1z,,"Comet Neowise captured from Bhopal. Had to stack 115 images together to get any details on the comet due to clouds [Nikon D3100, 3800x3072] [OC]",Photography," #**Yes, the comet is still visible and should stay that way for the next 2 weeks**  

#How to watch it:  
1) Unless you're in a very dark location, I don't think it will be visible with your naked eyes. Telescope or binoculars may work, but I couldn't see the comet from my small-ass telescope either. In my opinion, your best bet would be to use a DSLR or phone camera(more about that in a minute)  

2) First, we need to find the comet. Right now it's visible after about 8pm in the North West direction just above the horizon. In order to find it properly, download any star chart app that shows you the comet. I'm using [SkySafari](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simulationcurriculum.skysafari5&hl=en_IN) for the time being.  

3) Ideally you should use a DSLR to capture the comet. But in case you don't have one, you can try shooting it with your phone camera as long as your phone has a manual/pro mode.  

4) Put your phone/camera on a tripod or in an inclined position(hand held shots won't work), go to manual mode and change the following settings:  
a) Set the ISO to 1600 or 3200  
b) Set the focus to infinity  
c) Set the shutter duration to 20s  

Take a few shots and zoom in. If the conditions are right and you were pointing the camera in the right area, you should see the comet with its wispy tail.  

You can take multiple exposures to stack them but be warned, it literally took me hours to get them stacked since most Stacking software require lots of stars in the sky to work and tend to ignore the comets.  

Once it starts dimming, Comet Neowise will only return after 7000 years so unless you can develop an immortality potion or make some horcruxes, I'd say you should try and capture/view it if possible.

If you have any questions or doubts, feel free to ask me and I'll try to help you out as much as possible :)  

PS- If anyone knows a better way to specifically stack comets, please help me out too. Reminds me of Kimi no na wa. Beautiful photography <3 Post in r/Astronomy too. Getting that on a D3100 is damn impressive You can try using the astrophotography mode if you're using the pixel camera or a gcam mod Remind me! 10 hours Good work!

mst7hw,"My uncle in his 60s, living in Lucknow, died this morning at around 6 AM. This was less than 48 hours after he developed a fever. He was already in a fragile state since he is post kidney transplant recipient. Transplant was several years ago, but he's still on some immunosuppressants. He started getting breathless within 18 hours of the fever. Initially my aunt tried to get him admitted in a hospital but there were no beds available. Some of my family members who are somewhat influential tried their luck but they couldn't get a bed in Lucknow and even in New Delhi. Finally it was also really difficult to arrange home oxygen for him, but we were able to source that. We couldn't make more efforts because the decline was so rapid that he expired today morning. Now crematoriums are also full. My family is in Mumbai and travelling is risky, my father doesn't want to miss his own brothers funeral but he is in a dilemma. Now another one of my relatives has tested positive. Parents are pretty stressed.
What I wanted to say is that the situation is so bad that you can die at home without medical care despite being severely sick. I feel frustrated with our government and our people, both who clearly knew how the situation today could be avoided. People not following precautions, government doing the same. It's like a person has set the rules but does not want to follow it on their own. It's such an Indian thing. I don't want this post to be political, and I think everyone who was flouting rules for COVID is equally responsible. I also really wish none of you have to go through this and lose someone close to you, because it's like anarchy out there and you won't even receive healthcare. I love all of you and I hope we all make it through unscathed.",My uncle died this morning and I just want to vent.,Non-Political," My dad have shown symptoms as well , one of his work friend tested positive . 
There is long line for test so doctor started medicine before testing as he is diabetic .
Last few days were tough .
He was on rest bed for days .
He lost his smell and then lost his appetite .
As if anything can get worse my little brother developed cold followed by fever . My mother developed cough as well . And I had heavy indigestion . One family members  followed by another got sick .
We were all scared those few days .
Things are little better now . Sorry for your loss, OP. Currently all 5 of us in the house are COVID positive but well into day 11. Every single day we acknowledge how lucky we are to be alive and recovering. The country is in a dismal state and you’re right, both the people and government are responsible for this.

Stay safe and good luck. Came across a couple of things that could help others stuck in these kind of situations:

1. [Ambulances within 20mins of call](https://imgur.com/a/d3kdTyp)
2. [Hospital beds for free in Bangalore](https://imgur.com/a/AbRk8ed) Atleast 15 people in my extended family have got it.  Some of them have high fever even.  My brother's friend father passed away from it. N he once came at our house n met me.  I was sad for an hour after the news few months back. People are reporting even getting tested is hard as fuck now a days. Either center are closed or there's a big line.  Stay Safe. Really sorry for your loss. Situation in UP seems particularly grim. 4 people in my family (distant relatives) have died due to covid in the last 3-4 days in Lucknow and Allahabad. Situation is very alarming. I’m sorry for your loss. 😔

For others in the same boat, please try to get your elderly relatives vaccinated if possible / feasible. There is some evidence that even if you do get COVID-19 three weeks after vaccination, immune response is good enough that the severe effects (eg hospitalisation) don’t occur.

Another tip: for those with breathing difficulty but not severe enough for hospital: try sleeping on your belly. It helps. 

And if you do go to hospital: oxygen, dexamethasone & anti-coagulants help a lot. Of course oxygen supply is unfortunately severely constrained as OP mentioned.

that his uncle was vaccinated with both doses. This is doubly sad. While each particular case is unique (especially people on immunosuppressants) I hope more studies are done to ensure we understand the strains prevalent especially in UP. 

As background, the WSJ noted that [India has fallen behind many other countries in the genomic sequencing necessary to track mutations](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-variants-are-floating-around-india-but-nobody-knows-how-many-11618565403), and this is a genuine worry. The new mutations which Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh reported (the so-called [double mutation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-56507988)) are scary enough, but **each infection is an opportunity for the virus to mutate**.

And we are only hearing of the mutations in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh because those states are doing good work on sequencing infected samples. I’m quite worried about the lack of sequencing in populous states like UP / Bihar. Goodness knows what variants are breeding there. Sorry for your loss. Naturally I am also worried about my parents . They are old and have all typical old age medical problems under the sun. The only thing which is keeping me sane is the fact they live in a small town (80k people) in UP. But their attitude towards the seriousness of the situation pisses me off.
I know it’s shitty thing to wish for  but sometimes I do wish that someone they know pass away or something from COVID so they understand the seriousness of it. Rural India is so oblivious of coronavirus. Your post is so similar to my uncles story. He was 57 yrs in Ranchi and he expired around 6.30AM yesterday. He was in Ranchi and after trying to find a bed in a hospital for about a day we lost all hopes when his brother in law from Bankura, WB (a very tiny town in WB) found a bed in a multi speciality hospital. We started our journey from Ranchi to Bankura at around 11PM the night before and reached hospital at 4am. He got admitted but left us in 2 hours, we were able to acquire 2 oxygen cylinders but the jousrney itself put so much stress at him, maybe. He left is wife and two kids and all are positive and are now admitted in same hospital. And today was their 24th marriage anniversary. I dont know who to blame, the govt or the people or ourselves for not taking enough precautions. He was such a gentle person and always smiling. So sorry for your loss.

I am currently in one of the cities in UP and it's people who needs to wake up and start using mask and social distancing. I have to go outside every other day to buy vegetables and groceries, and rarely I see a person with proper mask. I am fucking scared for myself and my old mum.

The way people have ignored all precautions, It was bound to go wrong and explode. I hope Indians finally learn to follow rules. Sorry for your loss bro. Hang in their. Stay close to your family. They need you and you need them. And we are all with you. We are in this together. Just stay strong. Was he vaccinated? Sorry for your loss."

I visited my aunt yesterday and her kid came to me and told that she is going to be an astronaut programmer. Now this rang a bell for me, where have we all heard about this shit.

Upon further investigation with my aunt and sitting her down and explaining all the shit those people are doing, she was smart enough to get convinced and understand what a scam that company is.

I saved my aunt’s hard earned money and you all can do it too. Speak to your family/friends and make them aware of these shitty companies tricks, and make sure they do not fall for it.

Let’s together expose these scammers.

Good job OP.

We need to discuss tactics and create content against White Hat Jr.

We have to create a mass movement! I have started making my family members aware of this scam a company. I barely participate in family whatsapp group discussions but I've made use of it to spread the word about this scam company. I have just emerged from under that rock. Can you briefly explain what this company is selling (I understand it’s something about coding), and why is it a scam. Please share how you convinced her Power users are real.

This is that guy who everyone calls when their friends and family, relatives need advice on which new phone, laptop, TV or digital tech to get.  
In other domains this may be that person who gets asked about which puja, vrat/fasting and all that nonsense is to be done. 

Meaning one might disagree with the validity of the activity but *Word of Mouth* works and it works to different degrees in different markets/societies.  
In a place like US the efficacy of it might be low but in India this thing has a higher value (for now), whatever it is in statistical terms. [deleted] Wait till the aunt talks to her neighbours.

People are not enrolling their kids to these courses for the skills the kid may join, they are enrolling the kids for the bragging rights.

For the next party when the mother can introduce her ""little programmer"" to the family & friends. My friend got a job with those guys , what should I do? >astronaut programmer. Now this rang a bell for me

LOL, hahahahahaha I have convinced over 10 ppl. . hell I even made them go for Udemy courses for Python .. WHJ is BS.. You were just jealous. That kid could have changed the world. If you want to succeed, you need whiteshat jr."

I hope you get to explore many more dishes this upcoming year and start a restaurant locally which serves these in the USA and get more people hooked to indian food Loved Nalli Nihari that I ate at Moti Mahal in Delhi.

mprnks,"Hello everyone I’m adarsh(changed) from small town named morbi from gujrat and let me tell you situation here is really bad regarding corona virus government is really suppressing the case and death counts, the population of our city is 200k and according to government we have 4,000 covid cases well ground story is different, I don’t know a single family who haven’t gotten covid. It’s like 1 per every 4 person is positive. And the best thing forget the vaccine we can’t even get the testing kits for days I’m trying for weeks now still didn’t get it. And modiji is busy giving away vaccines to other countries. The youth is dying and he cares about his relationships. And why the phak they give permission to kumbh mela it’s 100% that kumbh mela will sky rocket the cases. But if they deny they will lose the votes so he gives more phak about votes than nation’s future.



Thanks for reading.",Situation is really bad,Coronavirus," One of my relative is married and settled in Gujarat. He passed away few week ago, aunt passed away couple of days ago without knowing husband’s demise. They had just one grandson - a teenager who was the first victim and succumbed to COVID-19 few months back. 3 deaths in one family months apart, I don’t know what that state is doing to protect her people! The situation is same in Lucknow also. Because govt is suppressing the news people are not scared and are not taking the required precautions... They had to cremate people in bulk like 20-30 people together, in graveyards there is a waiting line of dead bodies. A lot more people are dying this time I’m from Vadodara, Gujarat and I agree with OPs words. Me and my grandparents are quarantining in our house. My grandmother got tested on Sunday and yet the report hasn’t arrived. The clinic says there are more than 10,000 samples waiting to be tested so it’ll take another 24 hours. Literally 3 days after they get your sample, you’ll get your report which is still a question. Also, most of our relatives have got Covid and they know others who’ve got Covid. It’s highly unlikely that the numbers are below 3000-4000. 

Although, people here are starting to notice the lack of accountability of BJP. People are starting to understand how the government has failed them and how they’ve been bribed for their votes. I do see a change coming. They have gone full Brazil. You never go full Brazil. Brazil model is power and money, at all cost. As some one who works in ONGC - Gujarat . Last few months have been a revelation (New Joinee). Guj model is a fucking joke . State capacity is zilch there . BJP has by design weakened public health capacity over years

Gujrat is strongly connected (fin-socially) with Mumbai-Maharashtra . Just not possible that new strain is creating havoc in MH but not in Guj. ; Also my Gujju colleagues are voicing same concerns as OP but i know they will still  be a Bhakt.

Gujjus will die but still vote BJP . They have been convinced that Congress is a Mulla party - BJP protects them and is a safety valve against muslims . Can I say something? im feeling scared about our future. So far things were looking manageable. But now we have the Brazilian P1 variant and the P3 variant. Two of them are the deadliest mutations so far, sending young people to the ICU as well. We can expect deadlier strains in a year that are immune to our vaccines.. I feel we will not be able to catch up with this virus. Our people are also illiterate,they will harm us more thru public gatherings, schools and election rallies. I think we are all going to be severely affected. Many of us may die. Lmao Think about us... I am a class 10 student and school mein 20-30 log (teachers n students) positive aayein hainAnd the school is trying to suppress this info.. nobody tells this to usThats because a month ago some school in nearby town was shut down coz 12 people came positive..

School is just acting as if nothing happened, no proper norms followed, teachers wear masks below the nose, etc.. Why should Modi waste vaccines on people in Gujarat ?

Even if Modi goes & shoots down few Gujaratis, the Gujjus would be convinced to vote for BJP with few speeches about Muslims.



/s Just a question. How effective is the vaccine? Can we expect a person with a single dose of this vaccine to be completely immune to Covid or do they still run the risk of being severely infected? They are possibly waiting for elections to finish before going into lockdown!! Here in Hyd, the govt told not to test more than 500 in each govt hospital so they can get a lower COVID count. In my dad's office, one of his employees attended a funeral of 600 people and 200 people got tested and all of them got positive.

The situation is bad here in India. Some states are underreporting, under-testing, etc. Please stay home and safe ya'all."

But there's a stark difference between an academic like Manmohan vs a showman like Modi. Please note that MMS didn't ask for water and he did not say that 'Bas dosti bani rahe'. I really feel interviews like this should happen or be available in local languages and done on an Indian channel with a wider audience than some foreign channel. How many are ultimately even going to watch a debate in English on BBC? Haters of Dr. Manmohan Singh, come back when Feku does a press conference in front of Digipub India. This man was so ahead of his times man. I miss Dr. MMS 😢  & I feel bad for cussing him. 15 years later.... He had thr brains unlike this shitface that we have now Economics is always boring and long-term, its a marathon and not a sprint. the problem is that votes and elections demand short term deliverables.

kytkn8,,'The Wages of untouchables are wrapped in a leaf and dropped from a safe distance into their hands'. Source: Interview With India by Margaret Bourke-White (1950),History ," It fuckin burns my heart to see that little child exposed to this shameful practice at that young age. Every Indian must read 'The Annihilation of Caste' by Babasaheb Ambedkar. It needs to be made compulsory in schools across the country. In today's day and age, I can't even imagine who or how anyone would have came up with this idea of hating someone so much that even their shadow is forbidden...And worst part, even today Upper cast people don't renounce their ancestors or their actions...

Brahmins with Lower caste people or White with Black... 17th to 19th century, Crazy time to live.. 

And Atrocities in name of religion (let that be any religion) have no bounds.. But Vro, British invented castes Vro. Indians don't discriminate Vro. man. I feel so ashamed. One of my uncles forwarded me a text justifying non-touchability as a great Hindu invention to stop spreading of disease like covid! and how the world is adopting Hinduism  !! Such the damage WhatsApp & BJP IT cell  is doing to our country! If they followed that much norms in the lockdown this shit would be over long ago It is an interesting photograph. The old man probably has a great sense of his own importance as compared to those other people there. We as outsiders, consider him to be a pos at worst and a victim of the culture at best. The ladies in the photograph are the victims and continue to be to this day. It makes you wonder about ourselves and the present day, the things we consider true and right and the people we oppress. Aborigines n Dalits were subjected to many such cruel practices for centuries. Yet, people today cannot understand how this have affected those communities socially and educationally and they’ve the audacity to question affirmative action. Caste discrimination is still prevalent in India. People were vilified and are still being vilified because of their caste n roots irrespective of their financial status. That’s why affirmative action will always be on the basis of caste. There are videos in YouTube promoting caste and why saying Ambedkar is wrong. Feeling the society has not changed much I feel ashamed. He is fucking huge. probably got that body outta sweat of untouchables and labour I think reservation was important not because it ensured equality but because it ensured that people of lower castes were fairly represented in various facets of the government. Otherwise people like the ""budhau"" in this pic, would have subjugated lower caste individuals to all sorts of torture, just so that he could retain his totally undeserved, birth based power."

Edit: Someone just reported this comment and I got a PM in which Reddit gave me a bunch of suicide support links. Are you actually for real? I'm not suicidal. I don't know what gave you that impression. Does BJP even have any ideologies or reasoning behind their party besides religion? I'm legitimately curious Every one who follow bhagat singh must read:
1. Bhagat singh aur unke saathiyo ke sampoorn dastavez. 
2. Bhagat singh ki jail note book. 

You will learn a lot about the mindset of a real nationalist “When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late.”
                                               - Frank Herbert, Dune. Bhagat Singh is everything Hindutva, even Congress hates.
Just read his writings, especially ""Why am I an atheist?"".
He was a radical militant communist who fought for the kisan and majur classes, but not just that, he was one of the greatest critical and scientific thinker on the Indian soil. It sucks that he's been appropriated like this. Religion and Politics is a dangerous combination which only leads to hatred among society.
Politicians use religion to divide society to gain political benefit and because of that it hinders the growth of society. Unity in a society helps us to create a progressive nation. If the deaf are to hear, the sound has to be very loud. ---  Bhagat Singh Most people don't even know that Bhagat Singh was a socialist and had long forsaken his religion. He even said that this country could only be torn apart by religion. And sad thing is that today he has become poster boy of Hindu extremists. If he would have been alive today he would have ripped apart the BJP and RSS. Religion itself is cancer to mankind. Idealogies are always twisted to suit ones needs."

Occasionally the International Space Station passes in front of the moon or sun in an event known as a Transit.
A particular transit like this only lasts less than a second as the ISS moves pretty fast!

For this transit, I had to travel around 20km from my home to get the centerline pass.
Luckily the sky cleared about an hour before the transit, and we were able to capture the transit with 3 setups! 

Capture details:
Skywatcher 150P with EQ3 mount 
Sony A7iii

Transit duration: 0.55s

Extracted frames in PIPP

iwf5lu,,Stop violence against doctors. Artwork by me.,Non-Political," Why is there violence against doctors? Man the QRS complex on that ECG is all wrong it should be going upwards representing depolarization.

Great work though Its really amazing I was immediately reminded of the piece you made with Indian map and the violent situation of that time. (You should've gotten a better response from the public then) Looks like your style is consistent! 

Love the overall setting and the color choice! I'd personally move the horizon a little upwards and show more of the beautiful red cell floor that you created. 

Maybe a few more 'tentacles' (the baloon knot thingys lol) behind the doctors would give it more depth and make more sense to the red rimlight. Also the 'tentacles' can darken/die out as we move right to create more impact i guess. 

I usually don't rework stuff in my artworks once I call em finished and this one looks absolutely finished, so take this not as a criticism but just me thinking out loud what I might've considered! Excellent artwork. Kudos!! Love the colour combinations... Good Work Hey, Violence against any Person is wrong. If you think a person did something wrong we have Judiciary to punish them!... Right???

More like - Beti Jalao, Evidence Mitaon. This offensive display of superiority/power by the government and their audacity in thinking that they could get away with it. They have gone too far with their complete disdain on the constitution and the basic rights it provides to each and every citizen of this country.

This photo perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the slogan 'Democracy Dies in Darkness'. Remember this picture when you go to vote next time. WASN'T A FUNERAL OR A CREMATION! Scary Image Khakhi uniform has lost its esteem. The Indian state and its police are no longer in service of the motherfuckin' people. They're mere tools of the political class and their capitalist cronies.

Fuck the Indian police. Fuck Khakhi wearers. Hope they rot in hell. Yogi was watching the news from his office like a shameful person. I cannot believe that the cops are saying they wanted to follow the rituals correctly which is why they hurried up the funeral...who the fuck put the police in charge of funerals of the victims? Are they cops or pujaris? I just cannot believe this is real. Why are they even involved with the what happens to the body after the post mortem?

I smell foul play. They said she wasn't raped after testing her 8 days after the fact and then hastily burned the body against the wishes of the family. Smell that? That's BULLSHIT.

His way of storytelling was way ahead of his time. Truly a legend. [deleted] God bless Criterion Collection for bringing these greats to Blu-ray. Could I get some film recommendations of Kurosawa? I know there are many in IMDB 250 but still will like to know some more. Ray is up there with greats of world cinema like Kurosawa, Bergman and Godard but unfortunately not that well known.

Thanks OP for the research and posting this. I know that Sudhir was arrested and jailed in 2012 for an extortion case.

He was suspended from his position as treasurer in the Editors association who said they'd reviewed the evidence before taking this step. 

Although nothing was officially proven as both parties settled out of court as the case neared its conclusion, its interesting to note that Sudir won the Ramnath Goenka Award for Excellence in Journalism the very next year while the case was still ongoing. Lol it was a quick turn around

There is a 20 image limit, I tried to pack in chronologically and from a wide location from Indian civilization into this limit. Indian women fine as hell for 2000 years and counting. This is awesomeee... Any idea about how most of the depiction are strikingly similar in the manner of posture? r/interestingasfuck ""Aaye, meri selfie lete hue photo lena na"" to different centuries Did women in ancient India roam around topless? I see how the skin colour went from dark to white. Get this man an award! More accurate: male depictions of ""women admiring themselves"" over 2000 years. I doubt there were a lot of female sculptors, and women have largely been eye candy for men since time immemorial in virtually all parts of the world. #justsaying Im glad some of you guys enjoyed this. I'll post more historic type nuances from time to time. Some may find interest. Bye. Told me she’d be ready 1900 years ago"

kxrcmk,,Arnab Goswami's 500 Page WhatsApp Chat With Former BARC CEO Allegedly Leaked On Social Media,Politics," TLDR of Arnab chats: He meets with powerful ministers often has a line to Amit shah and Modi too, hates Rajat Sharma, has inside info on Navika-Rahul Shivshankar fights, extremely upset about 'landing' channels, is thankful to BARC CEO for 'getting him out of NDTV'.

Gleefully accepts BARC CEO's ""Jamming of other channels"" and lobbies with the govt to not blackout cheating channels. The reason being ""Govt's message wont be reach people""

Some interesting tidbits:-

On Monday Aug 19, 2019, Jaitley was in a critical stage at AIIMS

>Arnab:  “Jaitley Stretching it, PM doesn't know what to do, PM leaving Wednesday for France""

AND

>Rajat again raising issues with Punit citing my proximity with You (Arnab)

>""He (Rajat) in a mess with Jaitley almost gone"" - Arnab

>""But Rajat is over & don't take his bullshit anymore"" -Arnab

Also 

>""Hope the judge is not one who can be bought by India Today, It can be bad precedent""-

>""Unlikely Sanjeev Sachdeva is the judge"" - Arnab

....perhaps talking about the case when TV Today Network filed a petition against Arnab in the high court. 

And finally the cherry on top 

>""Download an app called signal, calls through it are safe""

>""Messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted. No one outside of this chat, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them.""-Arnab The suddenness! The sheer suddenness of the move! The unexpected nature of the move! The unpredictability of the move! BARC = Broadcast Audience Research Council.

Just relieved it was not the other, more important BARC. I have a feeling Shiv Sena kept this till now to maybe strong arm BJP, into making ED go away without charging Raut’s wife. Guess the talks failed, and one of the first lose canons from Shiv Sena has been fired. BJP’s response would hit harder during Sanjay’s wife interrogation, unless this spooks BJP and they submit to shiv Sena. Anyone who thinks this was done for the greater good or citizen rights, is being naive. Ethics are B.S in India, there’s an ulterior motive to this, you just need to figure out for what. 
It’s either Shiv Sena challenging BJP, or firing back for Raut’s wife did anyone read this? can you summarise?

How would we, as a community, go on to make this AMA happen? Contacts? Twitter? Is it possible?",Can we get Mr. Prashant Kishor to do an AMA on this subreddit?,AskIndia," Upvote this and send him the screen shot after 48hrs. Think he would be glad to do.

Edit : WOW!! this is going great. Let's get some hard questions for PK and ask him LIVE in the AMA. He seems a PM material, may be 2024/2029. But he has to be tempered like good quality steel. Reddit has some badass people to ask him some bad shit questions.

Please refrain your questions on how he devour his favourite fruit. I am very curious about his process ! Also curious what he means by failure to do the things he wanted to do in last UP election.

I have a feeling their process is highly data and research driven, like a marketing campaign... any other thoughts or anywhere he explains what he does ? That AMA will be huge hit for sure. We want to hear from Mr. Kishor, the young man who has repeatedly defeated so called Chanakya of BJP.  If any bhakt is reading my comment, i request him/her not to call his/her beloved Shah uncle Chanakya anymore. Chanakya was a great mentor, intellect, principled, and selfless man who taught his protege manners first. Your uncle does not deserve that title. I know a guy from IPAC. Will try to arrange for it. Mods, is it possible? 

u/Iammohit u/IamMohit Opposition should hire him to defeat Modi Would love it. Though, I wouldn't be surprised if we have to access reddit with a VPN after that 😏 Great idea but I don't think he would do it.

Those weren't the last rites or funeral or cremation. *Around 2.30 am while her family was BARRICADED in their OWN home, surrounded by COPS, her dead body was BURNT to DESTROY evidence.* By calling it a funeral or last rites, we give what the cops did, a semblance of respect. NO RESPECT WAS ACCORDED TO HER BODY OR HER FAMILY. That burning pile of wood  weren't her last rites! 


Edit: I can't spell Evidence destroyed by those expected to search and protect it!! The reference will def go over the heads of many Come on media, if every newspaper and news channel starts criticising we will win. Here in Republic TV, even though AIIMS said that SSR's was a case of suicide they are bent on proving it's a murder.

Idk, why are people not talking about this more on Twitter or anywhere else. This is a legitimately serious issue. SSR might be a case of suicide but this is a clear cut case of rape and murder. 
Now, why they did that, burnt her like that in the night like that? What were they trying to hide? God knows.

RIP to her. We're ashamed. A Thakur's Christmas bonfire. U.P. continues to be the most shithole state in India. This is one of the signs of the end of our experiment for secular democracy with a rule of law. We had a good run (just look around our neighbourhood). We better build much stronger foundations the next time we rise from the ashes so the bigots can't fool enough people to work against their own interests. rites weren't performed

she was burned like garbage. :'( i still fail to understand why they are fighting so hard to protect the accused, the accused dont hold power do they (as far as i know) ? terrible crimes happen all the time but the way they were so adamant to protect the accused is what troubles me. for apparenty no reason going as far as hiring a PR firm to misdirect people. cant help but think there is more to story than meets the eyes. maybe SSR case lost traction and nation needs a new focus?"

Edit: My bad for I didn't know about their content quality, but I just considered their influence on viewers aged 12-20, which is enough to make a lot of population aware about the WHJ's fallacious claims and hollow marketing model. Whitehat shooting themselves in the foot with this move? Quite a few influencers/tabloids are picking on this after the defamation case. This needs a hastag which can trend on Twitter. Did you guys see the front page of Dainik Bhaskar today though? It has a _down to earth_ article from this dude on how amazing his little company is. 

They are 100% going for public sympathy, and we shouldn't let them. Fuck WhiteHatJr Why are we not dumpstering their App’s ratings in the two app stores? Clearly there are enough of us to make an impact! I know Karl Rock married an Indian but I am not sure if he is planning to get an Indian citizenship. If WhitehatJr files a defamation suit against him, it might impact his residential status and citizenship plans in the future. As much as we all want him to get on board against WHTJR, we don't want this to impact him anyway. Targeting scam call-centers is different than targetting someone who has unlimited access to money.

liax48,,Deccan Herald slams Amit Shah once again,Politics," Goes to show how much BJP depends on communally divisions to validate their existence. Bhakts are always rushing to praise LBS only when they try to undermine Bapu The second quote is also bullshit. We’ve been bringing mosques and temples in our politics forever. If you can’t see it you’re wilfully ignorant. I hate how they have made people think that opposing BJP & questioning their wrong doing means that it is Anti Hinduism. LBS's comments are unfortunately, completely irrelevant in 2021's India.

I am from Gujarat, and most of my relatives think India's secular nature is a past history. Ram Naam Satya Hai *was This is a master piece from Deccan Herald. ED raids on DH getting delayed because Bhakts have a hard time understanding sarcasm My read is that BJP has actually moved on from communalism. No doubt, they are communal but that is not their main plank anymore, like the hay days of late 80’s, early 90’s and Advani. It has since figured out a more potent and intoxicating concoction “Nationalism”. This is a drug par excellence. Notice, how Shah ends his communal rant (Chanting Shri Ram) with Nationalism (“Pakistan”)

Reason for this is very simple. “Hindus” as a group are a very fractured lot. Cast, sub-cast, rich, poor, urban, rural, educated, uneducated, farmers, service folks... you name it. Hindu of UP is different than Hindu of Bengal and that from the Hindus of Kerala. One group could look to another with suspicion and distaste. What unites everyone is Nationalism. If you make them believe that somehow their beloved “Bharat Mata” is under siege then matter where you belong on the social totem pole, they will unite to destroy the mythical enemy and save their  country. It’s “brain washing” at its best. We saw Trump do it so masterfully that if wasn’t his botched COVID response, he would still be the President. 

Why do I say this? Well, for a very simple reason, look at the history since the Babri demolition and resurgence of BJP. If Communalism and Hindus alone was the silver bullet then BJP would have won every election since. Their growth into the southern states would have less daunting. Bajpai wouldn’t have lost the election when he was actually performing well. He gave the slogan of “India Shining” but his biggest flaw was that he didn’t sow the seed of fear that that “incredible India” is under attack and is just about to be devoured by her enemies, if not saved by the flag bearers of patriotism. BJP very soon realized that communalism and Hinduism alone is not the ticket! P in BJP stands for Pakistan"

My dad worked in a publishing company, so once when I was in 5th standard, his company ordered few thousands of custom parker pens to be used for presentations and teacher-orientation meetings. So, each employee got four boxes filled with parker pens and each box had like 50 pens inside it. So, when my dad got the boxes, he just gave away the boxes as in practice, no one takes a box filled with pens to orientation meetings. So, I convinced my dad to give me a box and then I became the prowd owner of 50 parker pens, and like a fkin NGO, I gave away  like 40 of them to my classmates. So, for a period of two months, everyone in a section 5 H owned a parker, all thanks to me and I became a god. Every teacher had the red ink version of this pen back in the day... cheap, robust and reliable af! I N D I A Everybody a gangsta until the real gangsta shows up... Yes. That's the pen. Nice ink color I remember noticing  one day in class every one of us had this same pen (all 30 odd of us) including the teacher (He had the a extra red one in his pocket). That memory is easily more than 20 year old now. Funny how most random things get stuck in your head. Forst time I have seen this pen with its cap or else someone always lost it."

Has he or will he ever face any backlash domestically? The Modi supporters I know have this narrative that this is happening because of the US. Do my eyes decive me?

Or...or is that a familiar salute? I get fucked paying taxes on almost every damn thing, I’m dead-arse broke for 2 months after paying Income Tax...I work hard and pay, follow the laws, respect the authorities...hoping it will be for the better of the country...but I’m called “rice-bag convert” when I ask:

Where have my taxes gone? Couldn’t they buy/setup O2 making plants at-least??


This is mu accursed reality, though the blood and bones of my ancestors have been mixed in this land from ancient times...I’m a suspect Indian. I shouldn’t question the govt. just because it belongs to majority religion. Even though I question as an Indian...but even my Identity is denied to me...basic safety is denied...basic health is denied - even though I’m taxed for all these.

My heart aches seeing people suffer and die...outside hospitals...

...the politicians have probably wiped their arse with my tax money Waiting for our INDEPENDENT Media to say,

* 1st wave was managed by Center
* 2nd wave managed by States
* East or Waste, Mudi is best I'm sure he values his international image considering he was travelling so much pre covid , so seeing it go to shit is satisfying. Indian voters have the shortest memory in the world. Once the covid dust settles at the end of this year,  Modi has 3 years to work his masterful oratory and captivate voters again like 2014. I sure pity this country of our's. We did it boys we are on International Media ""Headlines"". No third world country has achieved that and I think we are going to be here for a while .

1. This channel was 2 months old. So back then I used WhiteHat in my youtube as well.
2. Many people then also suggested me that my videos were going down because I used WhiteHat. 
3. Then I made second youtube channel named safed topi sr 2. Videos from there as well went down.
4. Then I made 3rd youtube channel and video from there as well went down.
5. Even videos where ENTIRE screen was blurred went down. 
6. Even those with only audio went down.

8. Please upvote this so that I don't have to answer the same question multiple times. It's not decentralized if it can be censored. You should consider using peertube or self hosting. Don't lose hope pal! I'll suggest contacting the youtuber Joshua Fluke (@JoshuaFluke on Twitter). He actually does a lot of videos exposing trashy job/internship postings etc, and many of them are Indian. Bro here's a advice, make an website in tor (else if you are rich you can buy a domain) and post everything there.

And try 4chan You shouldn't have used a possibly trademarked name. The people who review these stuff don't know where you're coming from and they just wanna get on their job. Here's a perspective from a person who has skimmed through your earlier posts here as well, you have to understand that just because you have a higher moral ground in this case, anything you do against an immoral corporate is not automatically correct. At the end of the day, you have to figure out what your goal is from this, and if it is to bring them down, we have laws in our society, I'm very sure they can be charged for false advertising or something but in court not here on reddit, and consequently what you've done against them can very well be proved as harassment. OR if it's your goal to alert people about how misleading their ads are, reddit should be the last place you could have picked. So, pick the right battle and fight it the right way.

Edit 1: To the ""fighters"" below, no significant video platform is biased against him or for WhiteHat Jr, he should or atleast you all should read and understand the terms and conditions that they have for the kind of videos you can put up on their platform. It is obvious WhiteHat Jr is going to claim violation on videos that he violates the copyright on, for instance Youtube does not have to care if its an ""evil"" company's request, if it doesn't adhere to their TnC, it's going down. I don't see you bunch rioting against Youtube now, why stop here? You have to be smart enough to not make those stupid mistakes if you really want your message to go through.

Edit 2: By the way, WhiteHat Sr is possibly the worst name he could have picked to escape getting his videos pulled down, the world doesn't work on your ""thug life"" laws, grow up. peertube for vids or try zeronet for hosting.."
l0l2p4,,The Wall,Sports," Formerly the wall, now the foundation. Truly one of the greatest Indian sportsman to live. That guy is Legendary. The unsung hero of the series is Rahul Dravid. All these youngsters showed so much maturity show the work Rahul has been doing behind the scenes with the youngsters. Also post on /r/Cricket I believe this deserves to be on the wall 😉 What a legacy he will leave behind. I'm sure the infrastructure and our grass roots levels are strong but time and again, we have squandered 'great' talents to the rigours and poor training.

Dravid understands to perform at that level you need the mental acuity and preparation to handle the pressure.

Let him have complete control on everything national level and  we are bound to have capable B and C teams. Rahul Dravid is truly more than any sport could ask for. He's a legend as a player. Now building an incomparable legacy as a coach. And despite all of his achievements, you'll probably never find someone who's possesses such humility. Truly the most graceful athlete our country has ever seen. Truly a gentleman. Not sure about others but he is my favourite indian cricketer of all times. So calm and composed but fierce on the ground. I hope we see more like him in days to come. Rahul Dravid should be the next coach once Shastri retires 😇 No wonder these guys seems to show insane discipline and maturity which are very rare for new boys on the ground.

lyt98z,,"Remove PM Photo From Vaccine Certificates, Election Commission Tells Centre: Sources",Politics," I don’t see a problem, usually on cigarette packets the danger is printed on the cover. Why was it there in the first place!!! Why on earth a vaccination certificate should have picture of a politician. tldr; The Election Commission has asked the government to remove PM Narendra Modi's photo from coronavirus vaccine certificates in poll-bound states where model code of conduct is already in place, reports said. The certificates, however, can carry PM Modi's photos in other states. Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress earlier this week had alleged ""blatant misuse of official machinery by the Prime Minister"" in the state.

*Summary generated by [sansa](https://sansa.news/)* Headline by NDTV should've been better: EC tells Centre to remove PM photo from vaccine certs in **poll-bound states** Wow. What a sacrifice Modi ji. True PM 🙏🙏

/s Self obsession aur marketing  kya hota Hein koi seekhe inse . Scientists and Doctors should just hang their heads in shame ..☹️ Also, ""why was there a photo of Modi on a rocket sent by ISRO?""

That wouldn't make it go faster any way! I don't see why he should modiji invented the mRNA vaccine. Biotechnology is a very easy subject once you master all the purans. Modiji photo deserves to be on the vaccine. Election Commission coming under ""new management"" in 3, 2, 1... Photo of Modi should be inserted under the skin of the chest area of everyone vaccinated. This will give a chance for everyone to become like Lord Hanuman. Modi ji didn't sleep countless nights and only using moonlight, water and his aryan race blood he created this vaccine. He is the only scientist who made this possible single handedly.

Of course she's drunk but damn, I haven't been complimented in soooo long. 

Rarely do us guys get this, and when we do.. Oh the happiness.",Been smiling since past 15 mins,Cute," The only people who ever called me handsome were my sis and my mom lmao LPT: If you get drunk enough, you should be able to hallucinate a girl giving you a compliment. Once talked to a girl on the train (not Parineeti) way back from work. Told me, I had a  great smile. The girl vanished, but that comment brings me smile every time it comes to mind. I am just an average Joe though and never received any compliments (other than mom and sister). *A core memory* Haha so wholesome lol The only woman who ever complimented me were my mom and my grandma, my grandma is no more so i guess there's only 1 woman now. Once when I was in college, a cute girl far away waved at me and gestured me to come over. I couldn't believe it. Curious and elated, I ran to her. She kept on waving even though I got closer and closer and then suddenly I realized she was waving at a guy from one story below me. She did not even notice me as I walked past her. That day it dawned on me that a girl waving at you, asking you to come over, is an illusion. Mind games. A Maya. Not real. They used to call me ugly until they saw my bank balance.


Then they started calling ugly and broke as fuck. [deleted] Bhai ab band bhi kar de smile karna. 4 ghante ho Gaye. The only woman I have in my life warns me about Corona virus every time I'm calling someone. Going by that standard, what happened to you must be magical."
j51wmv,,The Editors Guild of India has issued a statement,Politics," For me, going by what I've seen in the latest years, the Guild writing letters has as much effect as a 9 year old making a change.org petition for Unicorns being made the primary mode of travel for school going kids. Great, now stop taking ads from the UP government. Indian medias biggest enemy are among them. Why not teach slave media houses a lesson rather than writing letters. Lol. What were they expecting? Your can't use a rabid dog to target your""enemies"". Too shocked now? Weren't you when Asifa was murdered and raped and all media could do was play her religion against another woman who was raped instead of reporting both as heinous crimes. This guild can fuck off for all I care. They are equally to blame. They systemically undermined the democracy and now they've come to do their duty. Fucking clowns No statements when private chats are read out on national TV crossing all ethical boundaries of reporting & editorial but for this thye manage to get a statement out. EGI can suck quinton de kock. Intimidation of the media and investigators is all too familiar with police in India. The police in Tamil Nadu did the same in the Jeyaraj and Fenix killing. where was the writers guild when ssr was murdered???

/s just to be sure re baba Shekhar Gupta is an A-grade chutiya. Under him, Indian media has gone to dogs. In any other country, Editors Guild would have boycotted the shit out of govt for no PRESS CONFERENCE of Modi. In India, not a squeak. It is like a normal.

Prime Minister of India is not accountable to media! It's still difficult to trust these cowards,all these years working as a GODI Media and now suddenly in this case they are creating a scene like they really care about public sentiments.

lrz60u,,"I created this Web Application to allow people to document Potholes on the streets. Starting off with the state of Goa, and soon coming to other states of India as well. What do you think about this idea?",Non-Political," This is great. Hope this gets big. Need one for Bangalore urgently. Including a feature to tag local bodies in social media everytime a pot hole gets X number of verifications would be great. 
Future inclusions could also be linking of MVA related to the potholes. Whenever possible, the engineer & contractor responsible for laying of the road & it's maintenance can be included. We could draw dicks on potholes till they get fixed?? This is great. You should do this for Kerala. Is this open source? This is exactly the kind of project the Indian tech community should get on. Do check the site's public dashboard. URGENTLY. Seriously disgusting pictures. Atleast put a trigger warning or NSFW tag.  Is this intentional or someone trolling you ? Do not include UP and MP, you may get slapped with Sedition/UAPA cases from BJ Pee for defaming India. Potholes are India's internal matter. Is there a way to document streets in potholes? 

.

.

I live in BANGALORE. If my thinking is right, then from your application, people could identify potholes present in their areas, and all the information would be stored in a central database. Then the information would be superimposed on the map, and the app would identify all the potholes present on the streets.

If I am not wrong, you won't be getting any economic benefit from it, right?

Yeah, it's a good initiative; people must know what they will find on the road so they can plan accordingly. I always thought why didn't this kind of thing exist?! Imagine using a maps app while driving and you have the ability to mark potholes or non existent lane markings so the gov officials can review and fix them later. This is awesome. And you are awesome for putting an idea into practice. <3

Ps: it would be great if the govt can put effort into this kind of thing instead of asking us to report each other for anti nashnul activities online. This could blow up if you run ads and give part of a profit to people who document these potholes"

Honestly though, that man has never done a press conference, expecting one from him now is futile. Karan Thapar has traumatized him for life. Because he will have to answer the questions for which he has no credible answers. That will expose how incompetent he as a leader is!

So the better thing is to avoid the press conferences!! Can we trend #press_conference_se_darta_hai_Fodi. on twitter?

Why would he take that risk when it is easier to get elected back to power without facing the media? The other democratically elected leaders would do the same if they could get away with it. He is like a Radio, you only hear what he says. Why are you guys always behind Modi.  
He created a truly digital India, over 50,000 people who were physically present until today, now only exist in a digital format. He needs a teleprompter, or script. As **Ravish Kumar** Said:

n11sqc,"It could be just me but I have never seen an anti modi tag trend so high. Let alone with 200k tweets. Is it finally happening ? Are the tides shifting ? I maybe too optimistic but I am seeing more and more people talk against the government.

Usually when an anti modj tag trends there is a positive tag trending against it but today I don't see such a thing.

Update: it's now at #3 with 256k tweets. At #1 is #IStandWithSiddharth which is again an anti BJP tag since Actor Siddharth got hate and threats after his number got leaked by BJP politicians. #2 is an IPL related tag

UPDATE: Now the tag #ModiMustResign is trending at #12 on Twitter. The earlier hashtag maybe difficult to trend  because on Twitter you can trend a hashtag maximum for a day maybe. So if you are going to tweet use the new tag too !

EDIT: I am seeing few comments talking about how this means nothing or very little. As someone who has been using Twitter for a long time, I am seeing a shift. The ones talking illogically in support of the government are getting lot of responses negating their view point. There are people with huge following who are still supporting the government and changing narratives but I think publicly voicing your opinion on a platform like Twitter matters. Unlike Facebook where you can only see what someone you follow posts, Twitter has trending topics and trending tags which give your post greater visibility. So if you have an account keep posting there.",#ResignModi trending in India on #1 with 200k tweets at the moment,Politics," Update - 'ResignModi' now has 238.8K tweets, at no. 2, and the current trending one is 'IStandWithSiddharth', with 30.3K tweets. Facebook is saying they removed post with that tag by mistake, wasn't asked to. I wonder .... Gonna log in to Twitter just to support this trend. This is what happens when you act like you are responsible for everything good in the country. If things go to disaster, the very people who believed you will call for your head. It's hard to not want change after losing your family. People this should go on the front page of Reddit, so that more and more people are aware of the bullshit modi govt is doing. They went too far long ago for us to simply debate and forget by the end of the day. [deleted] #ResignModi Yesterday I saw the same tag with over 460K+ tweets. Update 2 - ResignModi has 278K now, IStandWithSiddharth has 60.4K! Like it or not but this will have to continue till 2024 because obviously it will have no immediate effect. People will have to push and be behind it like they pushed for Snyder Cut all these years (just a comparison). Only then will we able to reap the fruits in 2024. 

Do I think it can be done - Highly unlikely 

Is there a possibility though - If something has not been done yet, doesn’t mean it cannot happen. Let's hope so, man. Modi needs to go REAL BAD. Covid-19 is the last thing we're going to be bothered about if he stays - Worry about a completely authoritarian Hindu Rashtra with Gaumutra as the national drink, and state-sponsored MASSACRES of Muslims and all others who disagree with BJP/RSS. If you think I'm joking, I'm not - We're **this** close to losing ALL our 74-year democratic and social progress."

Edit:- Never really liked Drona either Even empty brains are not a problem, many have put shit in their 🧠 both are equally shit Holy shit that's boomer as fuck r/im14andthisisdeep Off topic

So I was taking tutions from this neighborhood teacher, I was in class 8. I had huge respect for this guy at that time. There were like 20 students from different religions. So one day this guy stated talking shit about Muslims in front of everyone, mind you it was after tution was over and there weren't any muslim students around. And everyone was laughing  like it was some joke. I felt so disgusted and shocked. We were f*king kids. I wondered how this guy calls himself a teacher! And the most sad part is those muslim kids respected him so much, I felt bad for them. 

Few years later I saw a facebook post from him, he enrolled his son(15) in some RSS sakha and was really proud of it. This guy wanted me to join too. He would sent me whatsapp forwards every day(those disgusting racist posts). In the end I felt bad but had to block him. I don't give a shit about him now.

Could be a worthwhile project to restore CID Moosa anyone? Well the exterior looks restorable but what is the condition on interior and would parts be available if it's made in 1970. It's gonna be an expensive restoration rather. this is a standard herald/ gazel, open top or could be converted , there was time in late 90's when i had scourged every scarp yard in Delhi from Jama masjid to moti nager to find one these, came across one near qutab with a scrap yard owner , it was in such a bad shape , impossible to restore , even the engine was missing.
the worst about restoring these cars is parts , you just can't find them.

edit: not a yzedi but a early model hero honda from 80's. Recently I paid 400rs to see one of these in Udaipur vintage car museum. Is it a Gazel? If I’m not mistaken, the Gazel was only available as a sedan or Shooting Brake... if so, then this is probably a Herald Mk.2 or Mk.3. Time.....is the only true enemy. Why don't I see convertibles around anymore? They're perfect for the weather as rain is quite predictable Jap swap the engine and restore it, it's gonna bring in a lot of money Wonder how many wedding processions took place on that car.

But if you download the official app and decompile it, the manifest includes camera and wakelock permissions. And they were used today, to potentially spy on my family.

And yes, it is the official app, and not a third party app. It's the official app downloaded from the store.

Edit 2: Thanks everyone for all of the awards! Also the support and criticism. I'll try and clean up the bug report and post a link to it here, but it's a lot of work to remove all of the personal information.",The Aarogya Setu app on my mom's phone was recording video continuously for 7.5 hours,Coronavirus," I guess the whole talk of putting the source code on internet was just a show. And also there are not accepting any pull request. Maybe they just uploaded to GitHub to fool people that it is open source.


edit; last playstore update was July but if you look at GitHub commit it shows last commit was on may which is two month back. That's  not a bug, that's a feature. Dude this Arogya Setu thing is actually maddening. My friend flew in from the Netherlands to Mumbai. He was not allowed to exit the airport without the app. Problem was that he only had a Netherlands sim. So he had to go to the airtel kiosk, get a sim just for downloading this app, download it, show his safe status and leave. Someone like you who knows tech could figure this out, imagine all the data these guys have already collected from millions of not so technically educated masses. This post need lot of attentions [This is the setting on my phone for Setu.](https://i.imgur.com/voFyqe6.jpg)

I am going to uninstall it. But would love to see you post some screenshots to verify this. If it's true, it's a massive story. Now bhakts can finally chant "" har har modi, ghar ghar modi"" This is some real 1984 shit right here. Dude, stay alert and stay safe. Also, refrain from morning walks. You and your family. I knew it from the beginning, my mom uses nothing but fb and whatsapp in her phone and so does my dad. Both were complaining that their phones were hanging a lot and I literally found nothing wrong in their phones even after formatting them. If Zucci bhaiya can do it , why not setu bhaiya? Is this still compulsary when we are traveling by air? Can someone confirm?"

my6d2n,,I travelled 300 kilometres away from Pune city to a dark sky location in coastal Maharashtra to capture this image of The Andromeda Galaxy,Art/Photo (OC)," The Andromeda galaxy, our Milky Way's closest neighbor, is the most distant object in the sky that you can see with your unaided eye — but only on a clear night from a location with a very dark sky. The galaxy is a beautiful spiral, but one fact you may not be aware of: We’re safe for a few billion years, but Andromeda is headed our way and on a collision course with the Milky Way. 

Since I live in a heavily light polluted city, capturing these faint objects in the night sky is very difficult for me. Last November when I got an opportunity to get out of the city, I travelled around 300km to a bortle 2 zone and captured this beautiful image of the Andromeda galaxy.

Capture details:

Check out my other work on Instagram @deepsky__wonders Now imagine that that insignificant yellow star somewhere in the bottom left quadrant of Andromeda has a rocky planet with an alien taking a similar snap of our Milky Way. You are literally seeing Andromeda galaxy 2.5 million years in the past. You are a time traveller in that sense Somewhere out there may be a civilization like ours?? Oh man. Some of you are so lucky. All we get to see is just haze.

Soldiers are in the border, where is your promise modi? Still waiting to see you burning alive. and he still got elected again, indian people deserve it UP Election won!

As the UP election day was closing in, BJP realized that it won't be able to defeat the coalition of SP, BSP, and Congress. Apart from caste, money, and freebies play a major role in swaying the voters. So BJP smartly went for the easiest weak link - money. In one stroke, all-cash reserves (collections) of the opponents were rendered useless. That's why Mulayam Singh said that at least 1 week's time should have been given to utilize the old currency. 

&#x200B;

In short, Demonetization was done to ensure the victory of BJP in UP. The whole narrative of black money, terrorism, etc. was just a facade to masquerade the main intention. Unfortunately, till date the majority of the gullible Indians believe that the true motive was patriotism. No official data on the impact of demonetization on the economy  either Only Reliance and Paytm got benifit from demonetisation"

kp0drv,,Former Diplomat K. C. Singh Ponders The “Internal Matter” Conundrum of The Indian Government,Politics," We have generations to go before our political leaders stop equating admitting to mistakes/ accepting criticism with weakness. 

It really comes down to how we raise future generations and educate them. We need to start looking for humility and perspective in our leaders. The current govt is the mob that destroyed the mosque. I did always wonder how does the foreign office manage to get away with this hypocrisy.

CAA is a law that by its very nature criticizes India’s neighbors for their domestic affairs and encourages citizens from there to migrate to India.

But then if a country like Canada even so much as speaks on the farmer protests then it’s somehow an affront on Indian sovereignty. Mind you there are  so many Sikhs in Canada due to them being religiously persecuted in India back in the 80’s.

Isn’t this a bully mentality? India gets to badmouth and interfere in the business of its smaller neighbors but also gets to act like a victim when a more powerful country does the same to it. bhakts are abusing pakistan and saying India never done the same like they forgot 1984 No, no, the destruction of the mosque is okay because it wasn't planned and it just happened 'spontaneously'

/s The Indian political scene is a lost cause and call me a nihilist, but I've completely lost all hope and want to get out of this country. Even though I've lived here in relative high privilege, I don't want to spend the rest of my time on this earth in India I am a Pakistani and let’s be realistic here. Pakistani hindus have no conflict with Pakistani muslims because they are barely 1% so they are easily neglected. They don’t even find hindus in the country to begin a fight with. I swear there would not be a single mosque get destroyed in India if muslim population shrinks to just 5%.

So whom the Pakistanis hate the most within the country? They are ahmedis or qadiyanis. If an ahmedi mosque was burned down instead of that temple, i bet my ass no minister would dare to rebuild that mosque or even arrest the culprits.

So this was a false analogy to compare both incidents and draw a conclusion. I get less optimistic about India's future every day. It doesn't affect me whatsoever but I am still attached to it. People used to compare India to Pakistan to show that India is a better country than Pakistan. Now people are doing it to excuse India doing bad things. Because in India ""Right to destroy"" comes under secularism. It’s not just any other nation asking questions. You cannot ask questions within India either or you will be promptly assigned a label “anti-national” “tukre tukre” and so on.... This applies to affiliates also. Diljit has a Twitter spat with Rangna Kanaut and lo and behold 2 weeks later he has an IT inquiry initiated against him. That’s modern day fascism for you. The system of the state has been weaponised against critics. Were exactly my thoughts, but then again dont want to start the year ticking some people off. Its just too much to sit ansd argue with idiots."

ismp5d,"Vansh was murdered by his sister's boyfriend and his brothers.

He saw her eloping with her boyfriend (a father of four) and confronted them which resulted in a fight. This person called his brothers and friends and brutally beat him. According to the family, he was then poisoned and thrown in the bushes. But somehow he managed to call home and tell them about his whereabouts. His family found him and took him to a hospital but he couldn't be saved.

There hasn't been any action from the police. They were trying to spin it as a suicide case. But after much protest from the family, they've finally filed an FIR for murder. The perpetrators are still missing, and the police 
hasn't shown any willingness to catch them.

All we can do for his family is to raise voice on Twitter/Facebook but i don’t think it will result in anything appropriate.

Wtf If you want to get this case in the notice of senior officers, you should contact local and state news Channels and provide them this story, many local people still watches them. In national media try contacting NDTV, Lallantop, Print, Wire, youtube news creators, generally they have their message box info given below in their descriptions.

I really don't think reddit is the right platform where you can get any govt or official attention towards the case, however twitter can be useful, try tagging local officials and state ministers and do create tons of stories on Facebook too about the case.

And rest you can just hope that somehow any post of yours works and police helps you by doing their job which they are supposed and paid to do. It’s ironic that this post has received a ‘Faith in humanity restored’ award.

Hi Neeraj,

Thanks for your response. This is a case of misleading advertising then. Would you mind raising it with your company? I don’t want to file any complaints without giving your company a chance to fix it. 


It has been been 2 months, no response. If their logo or even name appeared anywhere in a criticism they were so quick to get it silenced by copyright strikes and all of facebook,twitter and google(youtube) happily obliged probably because all the ad money or people involved. I suppose now that whitehat is in a controversy, google tesla and everyone in their fake ads can sue and bankrupt them if they wanted,more than fair. The dream that their chintu will turn them into millionaire had blinded them so hard that they refuse to see such flaws... From the comments it looks like there's a misunderstanding that MNCs are for the benefit of people. Make no mistake, companies like Google, Facebook all are for their own and their investors benefit. Unless this seriously hurt their PR image, they are unlikely to do anything about it. I feel WhitehatJr smartly made such unrealistic ads so as to target only the most gullible people who fall for it. A strategy similar to those Nigerian prince emails with deliberate grammatical mistakes. I just saw their ad on my fb feed.

I also saw WHJ ad on one of Discovery channel featuring Hritik Roshan.

These guys are desperate and pouring money like crazy in pushing this scam.

Some national news needs to pick this else this all might go in vain. This is one issue in which the whatsapp forwards will help imo. That's the generation that needs to know about this issue considering their kids are the target consumers.

It's either that or else....  ***Biased media is a real threat to Indian democracy....*** I wonder how many farmers they consult during this survey about PM ? I salute you for bringing this problem up. Here in the US we're having the same thing media manipulation. It's the media that are keeping us down. I am not a expert but for rating manipulation 40 lakhs is far less risk than what Republic tv makes out of it. Stonks Please someone ask mrbeast to take arnab to moon i ready to pay double amount That rating was given by that peacock he was feeding everyday [Source](https://twitter.com/satishacharya/status/1353682473822023680?s=09) Rating completely depends on the samle size and distribution. I agree that the distribution maybe fairly good, but india is a country of 121 crore people. Out of that, if we look at the the votes BJP received in 2019, it is around 38%. So, we need to keep this in mind that out of total people eligible, 38% people support BJP. Others maybe in some form, may oppose them although voting for their supporting parties.

So, ratings are going to be decent, but if you increase the sample size and distribution, I doubt that they would have any good ratings. Youth are now fighting for jobs, and this covid situation has worsened things a lot. I think this rating is just a booster for ground level workers. Nothing more."
kqrujj,"Yesterday, booked an Uber after a long time. A grumpy driver in a polished Innova came in, and it seemed that he had a fight with his wife early morning. He even had a problem with me opening the window for fresh air, and was consistently poking me for selecting a route that had bad roads.

While getting down at the shopping complex, I told him that relax, it will be a good day. He finally gave a little smile.

Had to book another cab after 15 minutes, since the shop was closed. Uber was busy, so booked Ola, and voila! The same Innova came in.

This time, his smile had broadened a bit, as I teased him like, both Uber and Ola, huh.. smart man you are.

He then opened up, and said that this was his 1st ride in 9 months, and he got back to back rides from the same customer, in different apps. It was like a good omen, he said, and told that it seems I am lucky for him.

Suddenly, near my home, his Ola app pinged again, and he received a Mumbai outstation trip, with a night allowance of Rs 1200. 

He suddenly stopped the car, turned back, and said seriously, ""Sir, aapko tip dene ka man kar rha hai. Kaise du?"" (Sir, I want to give you tip. How to do it?)

A strange energy was exchanged between us, positive, good vibes were flowing within that car, and I felt that booking a cab can actually change one's destiny.

We shared some good ol' jokes, and he drove away laughing and cheering from that point on.",I tried to cheer up a Uber driver yesterday. Then this happened...,Non-Political," > ""Sir, aapko tip dene ka man kar rha hai. Kaise du?"" (Sir, I want to give you tip. How to do it?)

but later on cancelled after receiving tip Haha, nice! Reading this brought a smile on my face too. wholesome encounter. Also OP you do seem like some lucky charm, keep on riding Uber :D Is this one of those LinkedIn stories ? Was the outstation trip an HR lady who gave him his first job in 9 months and he immediately called his wife and said baby I got the job ?

And how do people who use it, justify it? Can someone enlighten please ? I see all the creeps.came out to try and prove love jihad is an actual thing rather then a right wing fantasy. 

The question is how fucking pathetic do you need to be to use something so convulted to justify your genetic lack of game. 

I mean self respect doesn't exist in Sanghi world since they're so confident that a Muslim man just needs to tilt his head and the women around you will drop their panties instantly.  It's insulting as fuck to women.

m2id80,,"India is now the world's biggest democratic autocracy, as per report.",Politics," ""Partly Free"" Welcome to the club, greetings from Hungary! Nirmala tai must be writing another speech to call this report as misguided too. Elective dictatorship. > Narendra  Modi  led  the  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  (BJP)  to  victory  in India’s 2014 elections (marked with a vertical dashed line in the  figure  above)  and  most  of  the  decline  occurred  following  BJP’s victory and their promotion of a Hindu-nationalist agenda. India’s level of liberal democracy registered at 0.34 by the end of 2020 after a steep decline since its high at 0.57 in 2013. That represents a 23-percentage point drop on the 0 to 1 LDI scale, making it one of the most dramatic shifts among all countries in  the  world  over  the  past  10  years,  alongside  autocratizing  countries like Brazil, Hungary, and Turkey

[Full Report](https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/c9/3f/c93f8e74-a3fd-4bac-adfd-ee2cfbc0a375/dr_2021.pdf) Some excerpts from the report:

* The world’s largest democracy turned into an electoral autocracy: India with 1.37 billion citizens.

* Several G20 nations such as Brazil, India, and Turkey are among the top 10 decliners.

* India recently lost its status as an electoral democracy and its LDI declines from 0.57 in 2010 to 0.34 in 2020, following the government led by Prime Minister Modi placing restrictions on multiple facets of democracy such as civil society and free speech. 

* Modi and his party have also placed constraints on civil society and have gone against the constitution’s commitment to secularism. Recently, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) from 1967 and amended in August 2019 is being used to harass, intimidate, and imprison political opponents, as well as people mobilizing to protest government policies. The UAPA has been used also to silence dissent in academia. Universities and authorities have also punished students and activists in universities engaging in protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

* The Polish Law and Justice Party (PiS), the Hungarian Fidesz Party, and the Turkish Justice and Development Party (AKP) were still loyal, democratic parties around 2000, while the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) already assented to some level of anti-pluralism at that point.

* All the four countries became increasingly autocratic and Turkey lost its status as democracy in 2014, followed by Hungary in 2018, and India by 2019. Poland still qualifies as a democracy.

> &quot;India is, in this aspect, now as autocratic as is Pakistan, and worse than both its neighbours Bangladesh and Nepal. In general, the Modi-led government in India has used laws on sedition, defamation, and counter-terrorism to silence critics,&quot; the report said.

mi5ypg,,I see the rich kids of the sub have come out with their pencil boxes. I present you the indestructible tank of a pencil box.,Non-Political," Name was written on paper stuck inside lid Oh yeah!!! I used to be so envious of kids with this one ! I loved the metal feel and the new compass etc. This brings back memories !!!!! Ah yes ! The nokia 3310 of pencil boxes That costed 50 rs at my time.. expensive. Just had compass and  protractor which I used as a scale sometimes lol Remember the sound this box made when you dropped it when the whole class was silent? Yesterday we were showing off our fancy pens, today, it's Geometry box, wtf is going on😂😂 Even this was expensive, only rich kids could have afforded one. Camel was top of the line box at my place.

I got just some generic D, scale and compass. Somehow my dad convinced me that the rest else was not needed, and he was absolutely right.

Kids having camel boxes were the big show-offs of my time. Yip. These absolutely had to fall during pin drop silence activities. [removed] Looking at this gives me PTSD. My hands are shaking as I type this. It takes me back to that unfortunate day 15 years ago when I was playing cricket with my cousins in our lawn. Little did we know it would be our last cricket game. My dadi, who was sitting on a chair not that far from us, repeatedly warned us that if the ball hit her she would skin us live. Her words still echo in the empty chambers of my consciousness. ""Bhenchod, ball lag gaye na agar mujhe, chamdi udher dhungi betichod"". We laughed it off obviously. We shouldn't have.

I was batting. My cousin was on the other end, bowling. He tried to spin the ball but it came straight at me and I hit it with all my strength. The ball was in the air and slowly making its way towards my dadi, who was now talking with our neighbours. Time froze. My cousins ran inside leaving me alone at the crease. Leaving me alone with my unfortunate fate. The ball hit my dadi right across her forehead and she let out a loud, deafening ""Ari maar diya betichodo neyyy"".

js0n06,,Bihar results!,Politics," I for one am really glad that RJD is not in power.

Nitis Kumar does not mean BJP. He is just another politician who is with BJP because he knows BJP wave is strong. He looked the other way and worked with the grand alliance when he felt he could win without BJP in 2014 and we all know what happened in the next couple of years.

And to be really frank he's still much better than RJD in Bihar. Having grown up in Bihar during the hay days of RJD and the Lalu raj, I can vouch that it can't get worse than that. 

Few things that I witnessed as a kid in the Lalu raj:
1. Kidnapping: No kid was safe in the state. I knew a kid who got kidnapped because his father got his house painted. Which meant he was earning enough to give some extra money to the goons who were sponsered by RJD. There are many such stories.

2. Shooting in broad daylight: I lost 2 uncles to it and a friend's sister to it. All because ""Lalu Raj me paisa kaise kama liye be, o bhi rangdari tax bina"".

3. Bomb blasts: Seen 2 bomb blasts. 1 was to scare the businessmen (father of the said friend who lost his sister). The second one was by RJD goons for robbing the polling booth on election day. We used to play on a government school ground. It was not big enough and usually we were the only group of people who used to play there. This also used to be a voting booth during elections. During one such election day we were playing outside the school and then we heard a loud blast. We didn't understand what happen and just ran for our life. Luckily none of us got injured.

4. Massive underdevelopment: The City I used to live in was one of the major cities of Bihar and yet it used to get 3-4 hours of power. This is during 90s and early 2000s. The state had not developed 1 bit during the 15 years of hell under RJD. Floods were common during every monsoon (they still are). Roads have never existed. Garbage everywhere. What not.

It was a living hell and I am so glad I was able to escape it. Now it is still quite bad in terms of development, but at least people are not scared to step out after 7 at night. Kids can go out without great of death or kidnapping. People can spend their hard earned money for their comfort without the need of paying rangdari tax.

So no I would never want the asshole Lalu Prasad Yadav or his family to terrorize the land again. RJD's 15 year rule was horrific where you could get kidnapped and the cops wouldn't move a finger bcuz all the goons were associated with the party . Talk to a Bihari friend's parents , most ppl wanted a change but didn't want RJD again , hell AAP should've invested some resources they could've done decently. Having learned the horrors of RJD gov. under Lalu from a close friend, Bihar is one state where I don't mind NDA government. Why was the 2nd highest voted thread about ""Democracy"" removed?

Not my thread, but just want to understand what rule that broke? [removed] Just saying things like ""We will create jobs as soon as I come into power"" means nothing. One should have atleast some kind of strategy and plan put onto paper. 
Also Lalu raj has been a major downfall for the women of the state and it's condition in general. Totally in agreement with u/Prukkah and u/keshav690. Rest of India doesn't understand how painful RJD years were 15 years back. I don’t understand. Idiot, knows nothing about bihar. It's sad to see this post has got this many up votes.

m1q9h9,,When people forget the journey that brought Shah to the position of Home Minister.,Politics," Wild ride we have experienced that has normalised some terrible things. How did Modi get away with 2002? How did Shah get away with Judge Loya?

Funny to imagine that had justice been neutral in this country, the last 6 years may have played out very differently.

[**Context -**](https://scroll.in/latest/989010/amit-shah-is-communalism-personified-says-kerala-chief-minister-pinarayi-vijayan) Vijayan on Monday, while kicking off the election campaign in his constituency Dharmadam “But I want to tell you, I was not lodged in jail for abduction,” he added. “Does Amit Shah remember whose name was mentioned in the chargesheet of a fake encounter case, was arrested and then jailed?”

 “Amit Shah is an embodiment of communalism,” Vijayan added. “He will do anything to nurture communalism. Even though he became a Union minister, he has not changed much. The leader of RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] which propagates communalism is here to teach us secularism.” The RSS is the ideological mentor of the BJP.

Sharpening his attack, the chief minister also referred to the death of Central Bureau of Investigation judge Brijgopal Harkishan Loya, who was hearing the cases against Shah in the encounter case. Will Ram Mandir topic help in Kerala? I don't see any other major selling point right now for the party as of now to promote with the economy f'ed up, fuel prices over the roof, no real local party power or RSS? I am not a big supporter of LDF, but right now keralites need Vijayan sir to keep the bjp in check. Only he and his party is an obstacle to BJP's growth in kerala. Tadipaar Vijayan just might be the best chief minister in India right now. Though he has his flaws, he's certainly better than everybody else. I am still looking for a link to the speech with subtitles. Can anyone help please If anyone like him is leading Congress, INC could have been a stronger opposition."
jhxyek,,To Become Mere Pawn...,Politics," Now bollywood will abandon her. Soon, Bjp won't bother about her. There are many actresses in the party already. When you don't know how valuable a pawn is. Don’t quite agree. She has three movies coming and all of them have potential. Thalavi, Tejas and Dhaakad . 

Her problem is she is hurting people in Bollywood and general public who adore her acting and would pay to watch her. Her fans are not really fans of the movies that have taken Kangana to her peak. 

She’s is pivoting to Deshbhakti genre . if she launches herself in Politics, just like He a Malini, Jaya Bachchan and like many Celebrity turned politicians then it will interesting still, Its too early for her to become pawn in hands of politicians... BJP and Shiv Sena are old and natural allies. They will be back together some day in future. She will be discarded by BJP soon after. Also, she is a loose cannon, Modi/Shah only want people who they can control. Today she is spewing hate on people (Kashyap, etc.) who helped her on her way up. Most who worked with her won’t work with her again. She may join BJP and then start bashing them once thrown out. Also she is an overrated actor (Manikarnika was a shit movie) This is all a distraction from real issues. Do you think a cringy movie is a peak film career? The reason she is entering politics is that she is losing popularity fast. Never cared about her opinions anyway Hritick Roshan secretly upvoted this. Heaven help us that we are not ruled by this Shitshow in the future. With IQ of certain section of Indians I cant be sure.

Happy Ganesh Chaturthi yall!! Enjoy the food and share it with your neighbours as well. For all you know there are a lot of people who are going to be alone at home this year. 🙏 *Vignaharta*, we really do need your presence among us this year to deliver us from all the negativity & evil that surrounds us!

this will be the first year in over a decade that i won't be visiting friends & family for the Darshan at their homes... but i'm glad the scale of celebrations has been toned down. i know how difficult it is for folks to take the decision of not opening their hearts, minds & homes to the non stop arrival of loved ones during this occasion - but i want all to understand the immense sacrifice it displays. 

thank you all, and be safe!

Ganpati Bappa Morya!!! गणेश का अर्थ है

*आज़म निर्विकल्पम निराकारामेकम्*
अजन्मा, अपरिवर्तनीय और निराकार.

गणेश भी हैं:

*अचिंत्य* – विचार से परे
*अव्यक्त* – अभिव्यक्ति से परे
*अनन्त* – सनातन

*इस पवित्र दिन - उस अनन्त ईश्वर को याद करने की कोशिश करें जो विचार और अभिव्यक्ति से परे है।* Happy Ganesh Chaturti!! May I ask you your favourite Ganesh ji ki story? Mine is ah, that one! When Ganesh ji and Karthikeya have a competition over who was the rightful owner of the fruit of wisdom and immortality. To prove so, Lord Shiva asks them to go around the world thrice. Karthikeya easily flies away on his peacock but Lord Ganesha is stockier and his pet is a rat which can not fly. But Lord Ganesha was wiser. He, instead, circumvents around his parents three times because his parents are more than the entire world to him, they're his universe. [deleted] Off-topic question. 

Your floor is looking great, are these tiles or wooden planks?  I'm looking for flooring of our house and a bit confused. Can I DM you for more info. Happy Ganesh Chaturthi to you too brother. गणपती बाप्पा मोरया!!!

Soft Paywall. [deleted] What can we do to help our country? Thank you for sharing this. Perhaps the data sets from V-Dem are the most interesting part of this article. There are a bunch of other indicators that one can gain an insight into.

[V-Dem Country Graph](https://www.v-dem.net/en/analysis/CountryGraph/) Nehru's regime was very stable on democracy indicators. It's sad that in 70 years, we only managed to barely keep up with 'Nehru Standard'. And Modi comes along and even that goes into the drain. Also, notice how we quickly rebounded after the Emergency, it shows it was truly an anomaly in the bureaucratic/political ecosystem. On the other hand in the Modi Standard, the decline is steady and monotonic. This suggests a systematic change in the bureaucratic/political ecosystem. It will not be possible to 'quickly rebound' from this nature of the decline. This Modi Era will shape India for decades in the future.

This is just sad.

EDIT: It was only UPA 1 and 2 that managed to beat Nehru's performance. [deleted] IMO Congress had 2 really decent men as Prime Ministers their first and probably their last. It is not an accident that the IT cell hounds tried to character assassinate both of them. They know no one can ever come close to what Nehru and MMS have done for India.

lpbt2f,,'Banning cryptocurrencies would be like banning Internet in 1990s and will set India back by years' - The Financial Express,Policy/Economy," technically, how is the ban even possible?

lets say i have some bitcoins in my wallet, how can they stop me from spending it? When people are competent, they reform. When they’re incompetent, they ban. What do you guys do with bit coins... Do you use it to transfer money internationally or is it largely to speculate on price? *Modi: jokes on you I’m into that shit* I can only wish for the clear headed days of life without internet. Make a new currency, ***cow dung coin*** and the Hindutva bandwagon will take it high. What's a few more years on top of the already hundreds? Since when has ""setting back by years"" stopped us from implementing stupid policies? Just keep stacking sats. These idiots are going to impoverish the whole country. We are only banning BTC, we are not banning Patanjalicoin (PTC), GauMatacoin (GMC), Shakhachaddicoin (SCC) or Hilanewala-swayamsevak coin (HSC)   

Indian crypto-shakha currency will be vibrant and defeat cryptocurrency in the long run. Imagine a currency that appreciates at every performance of the crying 🐊 in parliament? Banning\* bitcoin was a good move if RBI wanted to save the rupee, serious explanation in a ""pro bitcoin"" article: [speculative attack](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack/).

>The effect of people, businesses, or financial institutions borrowing their local currency to buy bitcoins is that the bitcoin price in that currency would go up relative to other currencies. To illustrate, let's say that middle-class Indians trickle into bitcoin. Thousands of buyers turns into hundreds of thousands of buyers. They borrow Indian Rupees using whatever unencumbered collateral they have – homes, businesses, gold jewelry, etc. They use these Rupees to buy bitcoins. The price of bitcoins in Indian Rupees goes up, a premium develops relative to other currency pairs. A bitcoin in India might be worth $600, while in the U.S. it trades at $500. Traders would buy bitcoins in the U.S. and sell them in India to net a $100 gain. They would then sell their Indian Rupees for dollars. This would weaken the Indian Rupee, causing import inflation and losses for foreign investors. The Indian central bank would have to either increase interest rates to break the cycle, impose [capital controls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_control), or spend their [foreign currency reserves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_currency_reserves) trying to prop up the Rupee's exchange rate. Only raising interest rates would be a sustainable solution, though it would throw the country into a recession.  
>  
>There's a huge problem with the Indian central bank raising interest rates: bitcoin's historical return is \~500% per year. Even if investors expected future return is 1/10th of that, the central bank would have to increase interest rates to unconscionable levels to break the attack. The result is evident: everyone would flee the Rupee and adopt bitcoins, due to economic duress rather than technological enlightenment. This example is purely illustrative, it could happen in a small country at first, or it could happen simultaneously around the world. Who leverages their balance sheet and how is impossible to predict, and it will be impossible to stop when the dam cracks.

\*I don't **personally** think bitcoin can go mainstream rather consider it as a speculative bubble, banning the trading of bitcoin/crypto with INR would have been a better move & allowed the current investors to sell at anytime rather than complete ban of even holding crypto which could be impractical to implement.

Also having a deflationary currency(bitcoin) as a global standard could be bad for the economy.

EDIT:  bitcoin has different price in INR vs USD, usually because of low volume trading and high demand, [further explanation](https://techstory.in/why-is-the-price-of-bitcoin-higher-in-india/)."

He will do everything fine I shit you guys not, I had a bhakt tell me, ""only muslims and liberal hindus have problem with low GDP, they are just looking for a reason to blame modiji.""

- Linkin Park They cant fix the economy since they dont know how to do that, Listening to opposition party would mean they cant survive since they thrive on hatred and mocking opposition. So death both ways. Good but I think, large crowd cheering madly around red carpet, would have made this depiction really brutal. This is beautiful But the Gai(cow) Domestic Product (BJP’s development index) is still going strong. This is beyond Hindu Rate of Growth. This is Modi Rate of Growth. If I was incharge of INC, I would have created campaign called #ModiRateOfGrowth and equated Modi permanently to his colossal failure."

I will remember the fire, health minister Harshvardhan set to this country, after the covid pandemic broke out. He is a national shame. He doesn't care. Nobody does. They know they'll have their cozy govt jobs no matter what. The public demands communalism. They deliver it. The majority of the voters don't want better healthcare, education or progress in general. Even the highly educated rely on Ayurveda & hOmEOpAthy. They firmly believe Coronil will save the nation. This nation has no future. We elect donkeys to lord over us & we are happy with it.

Do they send newspapers all across the country or it is just limited to WB ? SC IN THIS MATTER ruled that only thing they could have checked was that whether correct procedure was followed while giving contract, while designing, whether Environmental norms were followed or Not. i think it is partially correct because they limited themselves by examining the constitutionality of the project and not extended themselves into political sphere which is the work of Parliament. by doing that they followed doctrine of separation of power. it is parliament and opposition who is proving ineffective. as much as i wanted to shift this project money into some other work but that is not the work of court, as they are not the government. it is us and parliament that should raise voice against it. wow i feel actually proud of the telegraph now. very good job on calling out the SC. i just hope the newspaper doesn't ""mysteriously"" shut down or something. Hurts me to see such a prestigious institution turn into a joke Until the underprivileged section of this country is uplifted, new parliament is unnecessary expenses. This money could have been put to better use. Congress plans, BJP executes by increasing taxes and burdening citizens. It’s a shame. What is an OD in the ICICI advertisement? Over Dose? Not sure why the constant need to hyphenate with Pakistan. Every party or state or institution is better in India than Pakistan. Better to compare against Bangladesh if you want to compare The entire BJP regime is a vanity project: statues and tall buildings in a country clamouring for humane laws, food security, education, and infrastructure.

If you can't save a state from a problem how can you or will you save the country The current state of affairs in this country troubles me. We have a state that is flooded and more than 80 people dead. For us Ram Mandir bhoomi puja, Sushant Singh Rajpoot's suicide, bollywood nepotism, gehlot- pilot, delhi, and Kangana Randaut are far more important than the citizens of this nation. 

As of now 100+ deaths, and more than 25 lacs people are affected. 

Media is dead. Nation is dead. We are dead.


What is left for a virus to kill in a morally corrupt nation - Rana Ayyub. And one thing , dont donate to chief minister sarbanand sonowal fund its useless . They re taking our money and not helping or giving reliefs those who needs them . If you have some relatives or you know some person then tell them to bur ration to the flood affected people . Media always looks for hot news...🤔 I am from Assam & I have been hearing many talks about national media not showing any news about Assam flood. But to be honest I have frnds in many regions of the country & they r asking whether I m safe or not & I asked them where they got the news & most of them took the name of prominent news channel of India. The thing I don't understand is if they r showing the news thn what national media attention the people of Assam is talking about. Well I am also not sure regarding this thing but I think instead of going with the flow of rumors we should check by ourselves whether the rumors are true or not? The problem is people believ north east to be somewhere outside india because apparently they look different. It’s shameful that it rains in delhi for 2 days and it’s national news but assam floods is not Okay let me play the devil's advocate here and say, what is wrong with the assam govt? 

This is not an isolated incident this no one give a fuck about assam thing happens every year. Is the government not supposed to do something about it ? 

Not about the media attention, about the floods. Doorknob goswami ( a native Assamese ) Is editor in chief of Republic TV . BJP is in power in state and center.  You do the math.

Also: Assam disappeard from republic TV after NRC was passed. The BJP govt would probably be happy to sell the NE for a lot of sweet Chinese yuan."

So yes, it is a great idea to make an effort to go plant trees with falling oxygen levels (/s).

In a different era, she would have single handedly founded homeopathy because this goes by the same principle of ""like cures like"".. exertion causing lower oxygen levels  increases oxygen levels.

That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it. Probably apathy stemming from learned helplessness. We have been fucked so many times by trying to reform the government, that we have decided to just let things run its course without intervening. Indians don't like to take losses. Look at all the people owning yesbank shares, they kept doubling down the cheaper it got hoping for a bigger profit later.

We haven't really gone though a recession in our lifetimes to keep us cautious and it seems like people are now going to experience it first hand.

A friend yesterday was scared because 200people in his company were laid off. This is the same person who was vehemently defending the government last year when they depleted RBIs reserves by invoking an emergency measure not invoked since the 1970s. Now we're stuck with a choice of a huge deficit and a rating downgrade and still no stimulus to show for it.

Amazingly, the bhakti is still intact in a lot of these people. They blame the situation not the government. The only solution is voting tactically next term and not get bogged down by the bhakts. Half of them don't know what we should be aspiring to as a country, comparing us to the middle east when we should actually be looking at EU and the like. [deleted] I firmly believe that it’s got more to do with the narrative being set in the media. Deeper penetration of social media and news in the social media has led to the growth of a plastic facade with shady roots. 

We have elected the people in power. Some leaders have astounded me with their ability to govern while others have reminisced episodes of ‘House of Cards’. 

We have definitely entered the age where public service is a thing of past and to expect it from our own leaders is naïveté.

In an era of misinformation, we must not make the fallacy of blaming and appreciating our leaders blindly. 
We must rely on facts, cross-reference stories in order to verify the veracity of the information. *Mandir chahiye!!!*

They just exist on a spectrum  of how much they want to kill minorities/lower  caste and  controlling the women near them as beautiful objects. Everything else is a child looking at clouds and thinking they are cotton candy. [removed] Its just plain bigotry believe it or not people never voted him for ecoonomy employment or other sane reasons they voted him well knowing of his riots and other crimes he has done and the hatred he has and he is doing that splendidly....people are ready to suffer as long as minorities get killed or suffer more I literally do not speak Politics with my mom anymore. She is super duper convinced, he is really good. I am partly to blame, since I am not an avid Politics follower myself, but I often ask questions regardless who the politician is, since I like to question everything and try my best not to show loyalty. 

And it began, when we started with demonetization. I was super skeptical at that time. My Parents though they struggled, they kept saying it is because of Pakistan we had to go through with this pain and justified it. They did not seem to care to the actual deaths and monetary loss of poor people. 

The other stuff Modi does? She actually does not know, I got to know, I knew more of the reality than her. She did not catch the drift on his religious justice imbalance. Somehow she is convinced, Modi has done insane good stuff and less to none failures. Every time I cross question, she gets agitated as well, which is odd, since she usually I thought does not do that on a general topic. It goes like, he did this, I will ask what was the result of this he did, ok lets check it now if it was a success or a failure. Then she would blame it on his minions or the general public for being stupid or it not working. So all she remembers are the initiatives but not the results. Maybe this is the Boomer logic. Lets plant seeds and fucking forget what happens to the seed is the mentality? 

I can sort of see a weird trend in Politics, probably worldwide from what I have seen so far, people regardless of the region they come from often bind themselves to an ideology and catch a drift what a political party is all about and support it wholeheartedly without even thinking twice. what I really mean about it, my mom is surely a religious bigot and has some sense of superiority that (thanks to the caste system) has taught her over the years. So they just become a loyal supporter to a party based on the ideology of the party, rather than actual results of the party. Which is the opposite of how science works. 


So in a way, People in my opinion have to stop having emotions for political parties and start treating it like a science projects and evaluate it from its results rather than ideologies. Because Ideologies are often  asynchronous with the results. Read this somewhere: 
How many Modi supporters does it take to fix a broken tubelight?
None. Modiji will say that is fixed, blame Congress for breaking it and they will all clap."

Looks like Hindurashtra is live. If the world is in a matrix then India is in a matrix of ignorance Do you even understand what happens when you allow capitalists to take over farming? Millions of people will lose livelihood, they lose their bargaining power. 

This happened in the USA a long time ago and now small farming in the USA is dead.

Instead of providing support with minimum support price, the bill just asks farms to go to private market. 
e.g. scenario: 
Farmer who has 2 acres of land produces grain, a company like Walmart will say we will buy the grain, but only at this price. A small farmer can never negotiate the price with a large corporations like Walmart. 

The farm bill should have focused on building an ecosystem like Amul (for milk and other diary products) 
or the Bill could have focusd on providing farm to direct consumer sales possible by establishing small farmers markets in Village and then Tehsil level. 

This will encourage production of local goods and produce, people will consume local giving more income to local farmers, and it is more environmentally friendly. 

I could go on and on about how policies like these ruined farming in countries like the USA and we are letting it happen knowing everything we know. 

Stop bullshitting and start educating yourself. There might be some merit to the bill, but the cons outweigh the pros by multiple folds. 

No one in their right mind should allow this bill. 

By the way I know you are a troll, but it's important to say this for people who genuinely don't understand the full ramifications of this huge step backwards.

Edit: this was meant to be a response to /u/Eshanaiya- who is she ?  
what happened? I can definitely say that she is not daily, Dalit word used by many politicians for gaining power. Hope she is safe let's fight with currupt people."

The same article goes down 3 times and then my entire LinkedIn account gets suspended. Karan Bajaj calls me a troll saying I must be doing this for money fake or followers. The same night my LinkedIn account went down.  It came up after 4 days and then again goes down in some hours. WhiteHatjr employees start abusing me, my family, started giving me threats.  Their Sales Director had already told me that they were going to make memes on me and make me a 'joker of WhiteHatJr'. When I posted this on LinkedIn that post got removed.  Now the point that I am giving up is a clickbait. I won't give up that easily. But I am really disappointed with most of you guys, I get way more suggestions than the number of shares. Please share the video. I have tried contacting IAS officers, famous YouTubers, NGOs, journalists, everyone ignored the issue. Please don't give me suggestions like 'Why don't I contact XYZ'. Its not that easy to establish a contact and even when its done, they don't even retweet my tweets, forget about  making a video etc on this issue. So Please SHARE the video, just put it on your WhatsApp. Yes, do it. Srsly. We are now on our own. Only we together can make a difference. Every single comment, like, the share would be helpful. Let's show these scammers that lying to kids is NOT AT ALL allowed.  Let's make an example out of them for everyone else to remember.

TL;DR I am not giving up today, but sooner or later I would have to. Everyone has a limit. PLEASE Share the videos in your circle. Let's remind them that just because they have got money, doesn't mean they rule our lives. No One should be allowed to lie to kids. Please share the video. The hero we don't deserve. Honestly /u/pooniahigh, you've done the most amazingly credible job anyone could have done but the ugly truth of our society is that we are hopelessly retarded. That's why there are three types of people in our country - the people who take advantage of the idiots, the people who try to help the idiots and then the idiots themselves. There's no hope for the idiots and there's no point in helping the idiots. It's not nice but that's what it has become. I don't understand the obsession of Indian parents to teach their kids programming from childhood. Let's all make it a trend with a common hashtag #whitehatjrscam Done my part I saw the whole video and honestly, WH Jr is a mafia. I couldn't help it this time. I have shot a mail to the editor of the Hindu. I urge others to do the same, we have to stop this mediocre platform jacked up on the steroids of marketing money at all cost.

u/pooniahigh you are doing God's work here. WhiteHats off to you Sir (obviously pun intended, you do need a smile in these times afterall). Please know that you are not alone in this fight. Stay strong!

PLEASE WRITE A MAIL TO THE EDITOR OF THE HINDU. LET'S HELP MR. POONIA BRING THIS FIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN. HE NEEDS THIS BIG TIME NOW!!! I have high respect for the work you do brother but this is inevitable, big corporations shut down anyone that dares to go against them. I pray that some celebrity picks this issue up as their moral project and I hope that enough people see the incredible work you are doing. If you feel that you cannot continue this, I appreciate you doing the work and wish you a well deserved rest. After all, you are only human and you can’t keep doing this forever . Even if what you do doesn’t bring any change, you will be seen as a person on the right side of the history and that’s all that matters. #WhiteHatMyAss I know you've mentioned that you want shares and not suggestions, but i recommend that you go to activist pages on instagram and twitter and ask them to cover it. These people often have a following upwards of a few tens of thousands. I'd reccomend approaching Trinetra Gummaraju on instagram (@ind0ctrination), or (@sapphic.in) on instagram/twitter. I honestly don't understand how so many people started giving you flak on twitter when it's the company that's covering its flaws! People like to be blinded in this society I suppose.

You don't attack a whistleblower if his information has even some credibilty. Without getting to know the whole truth, it was sad to see people calling you terms like ""unemployed"", ""jobless"", ""jealous"". These big money corps can swallow anyone only until the masses don't stand with the truth. And this is exactly what's happening.

The younger generations of the already daunting Indian society have only just begun to suffer this new problem of having to learn to code, only in the pursuit of Silicon Valley level jobs. Can anyone explain what's going on? I don't understand out of touch.

hn90qt,,Make in India by Satish Acharya,Policy/Economy," People have mixed feelings about the lockdown. 

I am wokring from home, so I feel the lockdown as good way to slow down the virus. 


On the other hand, I do understand that people have lost their livelihood because of the same. so lockdown shouldn't have been put in place? [removed] [removed] Honestly people complaining about lockdowns are fucking idiots. Hong Kong has managed to manage the virus without lockdown because they have a strong and strict government and citizens who abide by them because they understand the rules are for the good of the nation and not just themselves. Selflessness is not a quality we Indians have. 
Although there are other factors which helped Hong Kong such as small population, prior experience with SARs (Corona's cousin), hefty fine and 6 months jail of you fail to follow rules etc.

So what can we learn from this? Just be a responsible citizen, stay at home if possible. Avoid crowds, practice social distancing, wash your hands regularly. It might not seem like much. But it goes a long way if everyone does it does. Be responsible! I never fuckin understood why they used a fuckin lion as a logo when our national animal was the majestic Tiger. I think GST is helpful for businesses spread across multiple regions within India. It's current form is surely a result of chaotic compromises between various member states. Eventually I hope our bureaucrats and politicians will streamline the rates. Perhaps after the central commitments to the state revenue loss compensation timeline is crossed. Please provide me some research that shows GST was bad for the economy [removed] (Before criticising, please remember, ***It is just an opinion***, Don't just argue because ""Mera Bharat Mahan hai, Modiji Bhagwan hai"" and all. Mahan hai, I agree, par har jagah nahi hai (unfortunately). I also want a ""Har Jagah Mahan"" Bharat.)

We anyways won't able to beat China. They have a fixed undervalued exchange rate which makes export extremely cheap and imports expensive. It is at 8 yuan per US$ and it's actual supposed to be like 3-4 yuan per US$, if there was a flowing exchange rate. They've got mass manufacturing spread over lots of land and concentrated workforce in the middle aged group with highly cheap labour and flexible labour laws which makes ""Hire and Fire"" really easy. SEZ are filled and state regulations on internal matters (like internet; Google is banned there) boosts internal business and export freedom gives boost to international business.

Now for India, we have stringent labour laws to empower them, high manufacturing cost, restrictions on FDI (Fun Fact: According to Nike's Official site, there is absolutely **no company owned Nike store in India**, and do I need to tell about Nike's popularity here?). India makes it expensive for a foreign company to invest because it first has to tie up with a local subsidiary in a 51 (Indian) - 49 (foreign) JV. Land isn't there to build factories exporting regualtions are bad, because exchange rate is pretty weak, taxes are high on trade, government is having a budget issue. Did you know, a car costing 1 crore world-wide costs 2.5 crores to drive on road in India? A 7 crore Lamborghini actually costs 2 crores, but the tax is very high. 

We can't afford to fight China, it has globally penetrated market. I have done my 70 page economic project thesis on this.

Oh yes, for [the reference (small one though)](https://www.tutor2u.net/geography/reference/factors-explaining-the-rapid-economic-growth-of-china-in-recent-decades) , this is it.

klmwng,,Shivsena workers put up this poster outside the ED office in Mumbai,Politics," Lmao, fixed it! Only SS can do this btw... When two degenerate organisations exchange blows, its one of the best feelings ever.

But the fun stops when one of them wins. Cause the ED is raiding Shiv Sena MP's & MLA's .I don't know whether they have any proof or not , but it happened after Uddhav Thackeray spoke against BJP . It seems like the ED has a personal vendetta against them . This remind me of kunal kamra when he went to arnab goswami office BJP is so f\*\*king bad that even Shiv Sena and Mamata look good options now. Haha yes shitty authoritarian parties go brrrrrr They're not even trying to hide it anymore, it's brazen and out in the open and bhakts are low key proud that bjp exerts influence over the judiciary and other government watchdogs. r/madlads Can someone translate this...? What does it say..? Everyone shitting on Shiv Sena here missing just how much more direct and effective they are as an opposition compared to the pathetic slobs who gave us what will become 10 years of this shit.

I'm sure they convert more people to their side that RaGa ever has.

Fight fire with fire. Congress bemoaning the loss of independent institutions for years is barely as effective as something as direct as this.

It is like how, in Berserk, the Band of the Hawk had to ally with the demon army to fight Emperor Ganishka's Emperor Ganishkas. Except that makes Uddhav Thackeray...Griffith...ok yeah nevermind This seems to be a good idea, opposition may put a poster of ""BJ Pee Party Office"" in front of supreme court, RBI, RTI, Agriculture minister, Railway Minister, Parliament, CBI, ED, NCB, Election Commission, etc.

'India must prepare for a tsunami of coronavirus cases' - BBC News](https://twitter.com/NicolaCareem/status/1384565775369969669?s=19) That lady calling out ""Balaji"" absolutely broke me. I hope these people are able to piece their life together. This is such a tragic time for our country. Show it to people still going on political rallies, show it to the one's saying covid is a hoax and a shitty conspiracy, Show it to the one's that fight just to avoid wearing a mask. This is really painful to watch. I can just hope everything will get better because they have to. My entire family is positive including me. It took me 12 hours and trips to 5 different hospitals along with innumerable calls to others to finally get a bed.

It's very very hard out there guys, people with covid are spread like flies in all hospitals.

 Please stay safe it is very dangerous out there. I promise to take any warnings about the scenes being upsetting more seriously from now. It is unbearable to watch. Is there an article looking into how we messed up preparing for second wave? Or even assuming there would be a second wave? This was painful to watch. I can't help but feel helpless. I too ly awake thinking about scenarios which many of us aren't prepared for. 

I hope people don't forget what their negligence costed everyone. I hope to see a change in people where everybody follows norms irrespective of any hearsay.

Are the precautionary measures worse than this suffering ? I'm going to educate every chin guard wearer and anti - maskers that I come across. 

These are tough times, it's the least we could be doing as a society to survive & overcome this horrible situation. I broke into tears watching this, having lost my father 3 days ago due to the virus (he got every good facility possible) and left me, a 14 year old innocent boy who just got in tenth grade, my sister ,22 who's marriage was planned to be in this year and doing course in cartoon animation 3d and my mom ,50 a housewife who's whole life was her husband , devestated broken into pieces 😢 , Thank you BBC .

mta0f7,,"Former PM Dr Manmohan Singh writes PM Narendra Modi, ""The key to our fight against COVID19 must be ramping up the vaccination effort. We must resist the temptation to look at the absolute numbers being vaccinated, and focus instead on the percentage of the population vaccinated""",Politics," Great, RS Prasad and Smiti Irani will earn their salary for today by attacking former Prime Minister.

Might even get an overtime as Rahul Gandhi has tweeted about his cancellation of rally in WB What is amazing about this letter is that there is no blame game, ranting or raving. Simply has a problem statement and 5 solutions. This is what a leader with gravitas and vision would write. What a statesman, Former PM Dr Manmohan Singh.

Now they will set the IT cell on him. Ravi Shankar Prasad/Smriti Irani will make some asinine comments attacking him after which they will do what he suggested. This is the bare minimum work that is expected of the people who hold public office, an opportunity they spend enormous amounts of money and time BEGGING for every 5 years. However, viewed against the context of colossal mismanagement arising from criminal incompetence, negligence and propensity for cronyism, especially during this once in a century pandemic this letter seems almost revolutionary. For 10 years loud publicity stunts have been marketed to us in the name of ""good governance"" serving only as misdirection from quiet policy decisions that have continued to weaken democracy and public power with the sole intention of establishing pathways for private interests to consolidate disproportionate wealth and influence. Acheche din for two, everyone else can eat goo. But here are 2 pages simple enough for that even a a holder of degree in ""entire political science"" should be able to read. Authored by a genuine PHD holder, with relevant work experience, provided for free. 10 years of noise, mocking this mild mannered but qualified author. Listen to him now, for when he does speak it is with clarity and solutions, not bullshit and cowpiss. ***Full text of the letter***:

Dear Prime Minister,

It is now over a year since the world, and India, have been grappling with the Covid 19 pandemic. Many parents have not seen their children, living in different cities, in over a year. Grandparents have not seen their grandchildren. Teachers have not seen children in the classroom. Many have lost their source of livelihood, and several millions have been pushed back into poverty. With the second surge that we are currently witnessing, people are beginning to wonder when their lives will get back to normal.

There are many things we must do to fight the epidemic but a big part of this effort must be ramping up the vaccination programme. I have some suggestions in this regard. In making them I want to emphasise that I am putting them forward for your kind consideration in a spirit of constructive cooperation in which I have always believed and acted upon.

- **First**, the government should publicise what are the firm orders for doses placed on different vaccine producers and accepted for delivery over the next six months. If we want to vaccinate a target number in this period, we should place enough orders in advance so that producers can adhere to an agreed schedule of supply.

- **Second**, the government should indicate how this expected supply will be distributed across states based on a transparent formula. The central government could retain 10 percent for distribution based on emergency needs, but other than that, states should have a clear signal of likely availability so that they can plan their roll out.

- **Third**, states should be given some flexibility to define categories of frontline workers who can be vaccinated even if they are below 45 years of age. For example, states may want to designate school teachers, bus, three-wheeler and taxi drivers, municipal and panchayat staff, and possibly lawyers who have to attend Courts as frontline workers. They can then be vaccinated even if they are below 45.

- **Fourth**, over the past few decades, India has emerged as the largest vaccine producer in the world, thanks to policies adopted by the government and robust intellectual property protection. The capacity is largely in the private sector. At this moment of a public health emergency, the Government of India must proactively support vaccine producers to expand their manufacturing facilities quickly by providing funds and other concessions. In addition, I believe this is the time to invoke the compulsory licensing provisions in the law, so that a number of companies are able to produce the vaccines under a licence. This, I recall, had happened earlier in the case of medicines to deal with the HIV/AIDS disease. As far as Covid-19 is concerned, I have read that Israel has already invoked the compulsory licensing provision and there is an overwhelming case for India to do so as well quickly.

- **Fifth**, since domestic supplies are limited, any vaccine that has been cleared for use by credible authorities such as the European Medical Agency or the USFDA, should be allowed to be imported without insisting on domestic bridging trials. We are facing an unprecedented emergency and, I understand, experts are of the view that this relaxation is justified in an emergency. The relaxation could be for a limited period during which the bridging trials could be completed in India. All consumers of such vaccines could be duly cautioned that these vaccines are being allowed for use based on the approval granted by the relevant authority abroad.

The key to our fight against Covid 19 must be ramping up the vaccination effort. We must resist the temptation to look at the absolute numbers being vaccinated, and focus instead on the percentage of the population vaccinated. Currently, India has vaccinated only a small fraction of its population. I am certain that with the right policy design, we can do much better and very quickly.

I hope the government will accept these suggestions immediately and act on them promptly.

With warmest regards,  
Yours sincerely,

Manmohan Singh. Lol, who does he think he is writing to? A Harvard economist is writing to a fucking dumbass thug whose only achievement during the last year of the pandemic is growing a beard. desh ko bacha lo sardarji I really think of the time when he quoted:

> History will be kinder to me He is asking Gobhi to be more transparent. Not gonna happen. Wish this man was in control of things , atleast he's got a plan .

lonera,,"Patanjali’s Coronil is neither WHO certified nor approved, media outlets run false news",Business/Finance," A couple of weeks ago, I saw a Patanjalj advt. on TV in which Mr. Ramdev was telling Foreign companies looted Indians by selling Immunity boosters during the lockdown period !

WHAT AN ABSOLUTE HYPOCRITE!! ""Ramdev also criticised western medicine and asserted that allopaths are resorting to ‘medical terrorism’.""

We should destroy all vaccines and give everyone gaumutra to eliminate covid. /s To be clear, lots of media outlets are also instruments for press releases. They also have instruments which are essentially advertisements formatted as news stories. They are 100% deceptive, and made with the intent to convince the viewer that they are real. Much like most of the Indian news media, facts aren't verified, and most viewers either don't care, or believe the things said.

I have had clients ask me about the effectiveness of a product which ""spikes"" covid particles and prevent them from being transmitted and kill them. This was featured on aaj tak, and claimed to have been lab tested by a govt approved lab, however this lab never reported this (there is a repository of all tests conducted in these labs, not one matched this description). It took me all of 25 minutes to fact check this particular situation, and aaj tak ran the story.

Indian TV and by extension their online counterparts news media, pretty much across the board has an embarrassing track record, and it would take a tectonic shift for me to trust them to do any actual journalism. Print media is somehow coming out with the greatest integrity (in my mind) The Health Minister himself promoting Coronil Shit of Thug Ram Dev. Who has denied having approved any such drug It’s just Hajmola disguised as coronil. Not even surprised. I despise these peddlers of snake oil and alt medicine. If it worked it would be called medicine. These quacks, be it in India or abroad make a living off of scamming people and thats not where it ends, they prevent them from getting real treatments. 

Truly disgusting creatures and its a shame our govt is in cahoots with them

Now watch as the Modi govt and RSS come after a 16 year old and jail me for a reddit comment Chawanprash bana ke COVID ki dawai bech raha Baba. I genuinely want to fucking beat up ramdev and tear his beard Its probably some Wacko Hindutwa Organisation not World Health Organisation.

The climate is absolutely against them and they generally have to suffer quite a bit. Plus not to mention tons of additional expenses.

One day when I will buy my own house I will adopt a street dog over any other exotic breed My family has always had native Indian dogs and they have been wonderful. Responsive to training, affectionate, tough and well suited to the climate. I saw a dogg owner in Nallasopara(Maharashtra) roaming on the streets with a huskii and the first thing was not amazement, but sadness for the dog. My family owned Rajapalyam breed dogs (a type of Indian hound) and they were the best dogs ever. The picture you’re seeing embedded in the article is of a rajapalyam. Best suited for farms and estates. Minimal maintenance dogs. My grandma's neighbors used to have a indian breed dog. We used to call him Jackie. He once killed a snake that entered their yard (fairly large non-venomous). He also attacked and protected their surroudings when a pack of dogs entered their yard and were trying to kill chicken. He got badly injured and made a full recovery. 

He passed away at the age of ~12yrs. Its been more than 10years and I still fondly remember him. Such a great dog. RIP Jackie. The dog in the photo is damm good As you say that, there's three dogs in three different directions that are barking around my house. I can use them to trianguale someone's position.

Just to make sure you aren't getting into any trouble for this. Can you believe that as recently as 2002, citizens were not allowed to fly the flag on private property! So I had this massive flag at home that i had for a long time. And recently we had built a new shed for the buffalos and had a bunch if cement and bricks left over. So just bought the pole.

nfmlev,,"May 18, 2021 : Congress is commercializing COVID as a political opportunity, Smriti Irani",Politics | *May 19," Isn't the job of the opposition to keep the party in power on its toes. Congress is just doing its job. Bjp must do theirs. Dogs are eating shallow buried corpses in Allahabad but okay. Smriti Irony whose entire contribution to the pandemic is playing Antakshari and making one mask is teaching others how to help. Peejpee gobarment needs to take responsibility and sack the incompetent ministers. Harshvardhan should be first to go. If Brazil can sack health ministers, why can’t India. This one's nothing but a two-bit internet troll, and not even a good one. I don't think even people in bjp take her seriously. Says Congress is commercializing the pandemic for political gain. Meanwhile, Modi's photo is printed on every vaccine certificate. It wouldn't have been an opportunity in the first place if you dimwits had done your job right you bunch of illiterate nincompoops. This female is so dumb. She has bangles ready when it’s Congress, but showers her party rapists with garlands. Dumbass bitch. Congress even before taking advantage of it, was doing its ground work in the name of sosiyc. Where were your workers during covid, oh i forgot, they were endorsing cow dung and cow urine. Today you have proved to the world that not only are you children of cows, but products of sexual interactions of a bull and a donkey.

ixi3ag,,Error 404: Trust not found!,Politics," Please add source /u/AatmanirbharBerojgar How come Situation of Farmers is so bad when everything policy wise was going on so great for them? Well the monopoly of mandis and middlemen has to be ended oneway or another ! Farmers only from Punjab Haryana and Western UP are protesting because of wheat and rice crops and monopoly !
During 1991 reforms , industrial delicening bought same kind of concerns from industrial sector but it turns out to be good for economy so jumping directly to conclusion when other state government are supporting it is baseless ! Forget about trust. Can you even imagine him talking to a farmer like that out in the middle? He doesn't talk to anyone but himself. Could anyone explain what this bill is all about? This Bill essentially removes middle men, unlike people like you its going to actually help farmers by giving them the power choose the buyer with bargaining power. Farmer has choice to sell to anyone he wants , AMPC are not being closed , this is a very baised post First it was Vikas, but now seeing the hurry in getting bill passed in Rajyasabha, even Vishwas has left the chat...

Waah Modiji Waah... This bill is actually a great step if implemented properly. This stupid trend of criticising every government move is so ridiculous. Just go and read about farmer distress in last 20 years. Most problems can be traced to APMC mandis and middleman who exploited these farmers.
Big merchant had formed cartels who had already fixed prices and the auction system was a facade. Apart from that, farmers also bear the transportation cost. If any corporate or merchant from other state provides better price, farmers should be able to sell them. That's what bill does, it gives them options.
Coming to MSP, government has clearly said that it will continue. For all practical purposes, MSP only applied to certain crops in certain regions. Sometimes, government procurement got delayed and farmers risked loosing crops to weather or storage issues and ended up selling in market for way low price. 
Now, food processing companies can directly procure from farmers. This will help this industry and will create jobs.
Only people loosing from this are big merchants and politicians who made a lot of money out of mandis. Merchants exploited farmers by denying them right prices and politicians took money to turn a blind eye to all these. They buy cheap and sell for more than 200% profit sometimes. 
There will be some issues naturally since lot of farmers lack awareness. That's where government should focus now to create open market and ensure no malpractices from corporate. You don’t know shit about those bills and what will they do to the farmers . Is it mandatory to criticize every move of the government? 🤔"
h0b93o,"Essentially, I went to see a doctor today after trying for a baby with my wife for six months. Doctor ran a few tests. Turns out I have ""zero sperm production"". Told me that I can probably never have biological children of my own. All the hopes and dreams I had came crashing down. I cried at the hospital. I cried on my way home. My wife cried after watching me crying.

My wife is trying to console me, but I know she is broken as well. We will probably adopt someday, but right now I am feeling very low and devastated. Needed to share this to lighten my burden.

Hoping that someone will tell me that there is something that I can do to cure my problem.",I discovered I have 'azoospermia' today. Worst day of my life.,Non-Political," Azoospermia is not a condition in itself, it has causes that can be ascertained, and in a few cases, treated. I don't want to give you false hope, but at the same time, it's always best to exhaust all options before accepting something as permanent. Apparently India is very advanced in fertility treatments, because of the cultural importance of children here. Do consult the best possible specialists available, go through further workup of trying to find the exact cause, and take multiple opinions. I am also a physician (although not a fertility specialist), and you can feel free to PM me and discuss with me any of your reports if you want. At the same time, it's not the end of the world - adoption is always an option, and even staying child-free could be an option for some. Wishing you all the best! Damn, that sucks. Take time to absorb this and heal.

You now have the opportunity to give love, affection, home and a dignified life to either an orphan or a neglected child. This can turn out to be the best thing you ever did. Good you are able to process this instead of keeping it for yourself, cry and let it out after which you will be able to make future decisions on how to progress. Me and mywife have been trying for kids but having a similar issue. Dnt worry be strong, you both will make it through. There is a saying in my place "" Since people pass on their sins to the children, people without kids are selected by god themselves"".

I hope you can enlight a kid's life, who has lost his/her hope. Sorry to hear that. Your treatment will depend on the causes for Azoospermia. It’s a very individualistic treatment based on lifestyle and type of azoospermia you have. It is disheartening but remember around 1% of male population suffers from this
Worldwide. That’s a big number. Don’t shut yourself, this doesn’t reflect on your
Manliness or masculinity. Be open and communicative with your partner. If having a child is a priority research on IVF, adoption and other techniques.

I had issues with my Testosterone levels few years back and cause was something else, get
Proper diagnosis and multiple
Opinions before you lock down on what you
want to and how you want to tackle
It. I sympathise with you and understand it's bad to be in this situation. Nevertheless, I would advise you to seek a second opinion from another doctor, if possible. 

And, do adopt a kid. There is a definite happiness in raising and parenting a kid irrespective of whether the kid is your biological kid or not. I'm sure the happiness in your fatherhood won't be anywhere less. It's no one's fault. You have to understand that first.. Time will heal every scar broski. This cruel world has millions of orphans who are in need of a loving family. You probably do not need my sob story right now but I was diagnosed with PCOD at the age of 13. If you know anything about it, you'll know that it means that producing kids for me as an adult would be difficult. It's another thing that as an adult, I've grown to be a woman with literally no maternal instincts. But as a teen, I always thought that it was probably for the best. It has its perks: 1. You'll not be contributing to the world population. 2. You can adopt any kid according to your choice and you'll be making that kid's life forever. 3. And well as an adult, I guess it's safe to say that you can have sex without any tension of unwanted pregnancy. :D I am very sorry for your diagnosis. As much as it may hurt now, time will heal the pain to some extent. Probably you will never be able to accept it , but you have both of you to go through this.  Who knows who is destined in your way and what unfolds as you go. Take care , my dear . My best wishes to you both. Dear OP, as you could see from these posts , you would encounter these overdramatic people who would lecture you about the nobility of adoption. For some funny weird reasons they think that the burden of such ""great noble work"" is on those who unfortunately can't procreate. They never say those things  to those who pop two or threee kids. My advice to you is that ignore such people. Esp, tell your wife too. 

It is okay to not to adopt , unless you want it.. It is not your responsibility. Also, what's so noble about taking pleasure by helping those who are unfortunate?  People often forget that those who ""help""  out others are actually getting this satisfaction which is generally glorified as greatest act . Isn't it the one who actually seeking the help the greater sufferer there? Or does adopting the one actually save the world . It is an emotional manipulation of the world . 

Why do I say these things now? Just to remind you that it is alright to do what you want to !!

I have seen in my life many of those who adopted kids inspite of having their own. And I have seen those who wanted to desperately want  kids of their own. Neither groups felt either great or guilty of anything. It is just their own choice.

I wanted to adopt children even though I have my own. But that feeling is just original and I think it is a screwed up idea if  I thin of it as noble. That is just effect of our melodramatic movies."

ha4s9s,,"93% Muslims view Hindus favourably, but only 65% Hindus view Muslims positively: Pew survey",Politics," I believe a big factor for this might be exposure to people from different religions.

Most Muslims are likely to personally know some/many Hindu people. Vice-versa may not true. Personal exposure is very important to break away from stigma and prejudice.

But Again, I base this on statistical probability and anecdotal experience. Not an expert Ofcourse. [removed] The silver-lining in the cloud for me is that even with the barrage of anti-Muslim propaganda sponsored by those in power for over a decade, and the rise of Islamophobia worldwide, 65% of Hindus still view Muslims favorably. I'd also bet that the 35% who don't view Muslims favorably belong to specific castes and regions in the country.

I did a quick google search to compare it to other regions: [How Muslims and Westerners View Each Other](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2011/07/21/chapter-2-how-muslims-and-westerners-view-each-other/)

Quote: 

> Majorities in Britain (64%), France (64%), Russia (62%) and the U.S. (57%) express positive views of Muslims. Opinions are nearly divided in Germany, where 45% have a favorable view of Muslims and 47% offer negative ratings; in 2006, a majority (54%) of Germans had unfavorable views of Muslims, while 36% had positive opinions.

> Opinions about Muslims are especially negative in Israel. About one-in-five (19%) Israelis have favorable opinions, while 79% say they have an unfavorable view; among Israeli Jews, just 9% have positive views, while nine-in-ten have negative views of Muslims. In contrast, 87% of Muslims in Israel have a positive opinion of those who share their religion. Majorities among the other Muslim publics surveyed also express positive views of Muslims, although fewer Muslims in Turkey do so than was the case five years ago (72% now vs. 88% in 2006).

So the numbers in India are better than or at the same level as the views on Muslims in many Western countries.

Speaking for myself, I believe that both Hinduism and Islam in their modern forms are deeply flawed and need thorough reforms. In their present forms, they are maladaptive. But I don't think that Muslims themselves are inherently bad any more than people from other religions. We are all products of our conditioning which we mostly don't get to choose. I think the explanation is the following. As a Muslim it's easy to interact with Hindus and counter any propaganda by personal experience. On the other hand as a Hindu it's possible to entirely avoid interacting with Muslims, which means that the image of an average Muslim in the mind of Hindus is more likely to a propaganda caricature rather than a reflection of reality. Who conducts such polls and how do I be a part of this? I am an ex-Muslim. I just want to add here that I don't have any views on either communities. However, I can tell you this. Despite my beliefs, some people like to believe I am a closeted Muslim running an agenda. Lol some of you guys are pathetic, you'll believe articles based on anecdotal evidences but one positive article based on a decent sample size and sound research methods and a reputed organization and you are shitting on it. Sample size is 3505. I have a lot of friends who are are Hindu but less than 10% of them had the strong bias against being a Muslim, the majority is far more concerned about me as a human rather than considering what my religion is  


I had a brahmin room partner for three years and some times he used to remind me of my praying time. He even liked how Muslims pray on times, are against the consumption of alcohol  


the majority is still friendly 35% of Hindus do not view muslims favourably. BJP's vote share in 2019 Lok sabha elections was 37.36%. I call BS on 95% muslims viewing Hindus favourably."

Fortunately, I got the NSA and all 3 extensions of detention quashed by the high court, which called the whole process illegal.""

>He also mentioned about the Gorakhpur tragedy on August 10, 2017 at Baba Raghav Das Medical College, in which many children lost their lives due to unavailability of liquid oxygen.

>The high court categorically stated in its April 25, 2018 order that there was ""no evidence of medical negligence found against him and he was not even involved in the oxygen tendering process"". He's an example as to why we must not stop talking. Let them know we exist and we will resist the fascism. If I were him, I wouldn't go on morning walks anymore.  


But, kudos to him for standing up. We need to become like him and do whatever we can in our limits to fight with this bs joke of a government. I appreciate what he is doing but UNHRC can't do shit against a country like India. UNHRC never did anything against human right abuses against minorities in Pakistan and Myanmar. There is no way it can do something against a country like India. 

Also it's a pretty risky move from him. If I were him I would have moved to some other country and then think about doing something like that.

 I won't be surprised if he gets arrested again or even worse shot dead. UNHRC cant do shit. UN and it's bodies literally has no power to enforce anything. It didn't do shit during rohingya genocide, uyghurs detentions, syrian bombings etc. Also in history UN (league of nations that time) couldn't do anything while hitler invaded poland, france, czechoslovakia etc.

UN is just a bureaucratic time pass."

Keep up the pressure, keep the spotlight on these fekus nonstop.Only way to fight them is to splash this out on social media in bold type  every single time . This actually back fired. 

You had Sanghi boys asking PM for the reason of silence and said he was being woke and not taking action lol [removed] ""fake"" is subjective in India.

Depending on which new outlet is investigating the story.

Depending the investigation officer's tranfer is controlled by which political party.

Depending on whom the action and reaction is carried on.

News no longer make any sense anymore In the early-mid 1990s, with the fall of East Germany, substantial number of their Police officers and intelligence officers were laid off/dismissed. Again, after 1994, and fall of the Apartheid regime in South Africa, big numbers of Police officers were dismissed for working for the previous regime. At that time Jyoti Basu, then CM of Bengal got many of them to come to West Bengal to work as consultants and trainers for the West Bengal Police and Kolkata Police for a few years. 

I know similar things happened soon after 2003 invasion of Iraq, Iraqi Police officers loyal to Saddam were dismissed/hounded out and the then CPM Govt of WB appointed a handful as advisors for WB Police. 

These trainers and advisors are no longer there but they introduced a lot of good practices and knowledge into WB Police on how to clamp down on oppositions. Believe me guys, WB is in good hands and Amit Shah is having the toughest time there in all India. The State Agencies can and will deploy the widest gamut of repressive measures against the BJP. Well this is good.
But this does not meant all was good in post poll Bengal. There were definitely actual killings and other barbarities on both sides Source - Today's Times of India newspaper

[Link to the article on TOI](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/bengal-police-get-500-fake-social-media-posts-deleted/amp_articleshow/82512470.cms) In any other democracy, the govt would've had to resign on moral grounds for such a colossal failure.

n33mr7,"My mom was in hospital for covid complications. I stayed in the ward with her all the 7 days she was there. And I could not help but realize how wrong I was in idolizing Amitabh Bachan for his success or some business man or  a famous cricketer who struggled some point of time in his life. 

We should actually be idolizing those who make difference. The nurses in my moms ward were looking at 10 patients in each shift. One nurse per 10 patient. 

The doctor who was visiting my mom is helping around 200-250 patients daily with so much patience that i started idolizing his professionalism. 

I felt grateful to the housekeeping staff in the hospital( underpaid ), the ambulance drivers, the nursing staff. 

I just want to share an opinion that formed when i see only few celebs( any popular person) doing ground work, and rest have abandoned Indians.

Our kids should look up to the lawyers who hold and fight against opression, doctors and nurses who help all. 

Yes there are bad apples in all professions but that should not affect us. The good has to be appreciated and brought to focus. 

While the News channels fill peoples mind with shit, the real ground work the real india is being built on shoulders of hard working professionals.  Mad respect to every such person.","We, most Indians(including me) have been idolizing wrong people",Non-Political," 100% agree. I do not care about these celebrities, actors and politicians. We need to better appreciate our doctors, nurses, teachers, farmers, soldiers. It is on their backs that this country functions. I only idiolized my mum. Never been disappointed. India is a country of worshippers.

Amitabh and Sachin both have their temples. 

Welcome to sanity. Stopped idolising most Indian celebrities a few years ago. They have so much influence but dare say a word. They have so much wealth (thanks to us) but dare help make a difference. Worse are those who take dummy seats as MPs and actually occupy positions of power without making any power move.

I do respect a few though. Culture of idiolizing entertainers is one of the worst trend that has happened in the last few decades. [deleted] You should not be idolizing anyone. Not philosophers, philanthropists, god men, actors, players, your parents, anyone. Noone is perfect in all respects. Respect and emulate the people who have earned your respect with their actions. But do not idolize them. Idols always turn out to have clay feet. I stopped worshipping celebrities years ago. The real people who need to be appreciated right now are our doctors, nurses and other frontline workers and also people involved in essential services. They all are risking their lives and god forbid if they get COVID they’ll have to struggle to find a hospital bed unlike these celebs who’ve been flouting all rules and then running straight to hospitals after testing positive. While I greatly appreciate the charity work done by actors, I don't like them merely for doing it. I like actors for acting, singers for singing, sportsmen for playing well, etc. I haven't entrusted them with the responsibility of giving us medical care, rescue operations, etc. As long as they don't behave like Kangu didi, Canada Kumar, etc or aren't rapists and other criminals, they are good enough for me.

There is no need to worship anyone. But I don't expect Amitabh Bachchan to help me, as much as I don't expect my doctor or lawyer to act in films. It isn't their fault if we don't treat household help or other professionals with respect or don't pay them enough. Be sure to thank frontline workers when you get a chance! That’s why we need dignity of labour, where all of us respect any profession. Engineering or Medicine and no other option shit should stop!"

Yes, data has been leaked. They are denying everything because they are preparing for their IPO launch for September. Their value is fucked if they admit to anything. Fuck them! Is there any law in India which punishes stealing someone’s identity ? If I never installed mobikwik then I don't have to worry? I can see all my cards, bank account numbers etc so clearly there has been a data breach.

They don't say when they got access to this data though.

I removed my bank account and cards from mobikwik atleast 1 year back, I don't see it in mobikwik anymore but these details are available in the breach.

So, Either mobikwik has been an asshole and only hid the details from me when I asked them to delete it or this breach happened in ~2019. What is mobikwik? I read that mobiwiki has denied any such breach of data, not sure, but is is scary. Is there link for this? What site is that ?

irrovp,"I posted a video on youtube and Byjus stooges got it removed for copyright infringement. They got my quora also banned for speaking against them. Please see the video and see if I violated any copyright infringements.  This text below is the appeal I have done to Youtube for removing the ban on me.

*""*  

*The removal of the video was not just a mistake, it was in fact an intentional and direct attack on my freedom of speech.*

*1. The content in the video was original and I recorded it from my phone.  The background audio was the natural audio, it wasn't any music or something like that.*

*2. Aiplex software works on behalf of Byjus and they are trying to suppress all opinions raised against Byju's company. On Quora also they are banning everyone who has raised any voice against them. This is totally wrong and it is against my freedom of speech. I have full right to express my review of Byju's company. They target 6-year-old kids with their false advertisements and I can't even speak against it?*

*3. The video was COMPLETELY mine and Aiplex has no right to remove it. They did it so that now they can get my personal information to harass me. But let's make it clear that I wont be suppressed. I will move to the courts and go all the way to get my freedom to express my opinion.* 

*4. Byjus is looting people and forcing them to take loans. In fact, Byju's and WhiteHat Jr themselves are violating copyright infringements of Google, Elon Musk, BlueOrigin, Barak Obama, Bill Gates, and the list goes on. They are using their names illegally in their youtube ads. How come you YouTube guys didn't see any wrong in that? How is that allowed and you are banning my channel for expressing my opinion about them?* 

*WhiteHatJr has been selling false pipe dreams of 150 crore INR salary to 6-year-old kids, and I can't express my opinion about that?*

*Reviews of WhiteHatJr on Google Play store are all Fake, copy paste, and repeat. Hey Google, how is that allowed and you are banning me? Under IPC section 416, fake reviews are illegal in India. Still, google play store isn't looking into it and banning my account for speaking this out loud!*

*WhiteHatJr is using Barak Obama's video which he made for non-profit organization* [*code.org*](https://code.org) *.*

*This is the original video:*

*Hey Google, how can anyone use Barak Obama’s video in their ads and I can't even post a video of a balloon?*

*WhiteHatJr seems not to care about copyright infringements and has gone completely shameless in selling their course which is already freely available on the internet.*

*Youtube people please look into this closely and please dont let them harass me like this again because in the future also I will keep posting about their false advertisements and fake reviews.*

*I will also be posting this entire ‘Counter Notification’ on social media to make it public.*

If anyone has kept track of various false copyright infringement claims u will see youtube will not help you at all. 

Your only hope is - either u take legal action if u have the resources or huge online outrage, get big names involved.

What they did was illegal and it hurts many small creators. Those fuckers are doing everything in the name of education. They should be exposed. Indian parents fall easily for fake advertisements. My cousin works in Byjus and has good salary. My parents are forcing me to join as well.

His efforts have benefited around 30,000 farmers so far. The village is drought-free and can store 22 crore litres of water, which suffices the areaâ€™s water needs for 10 months.

That time the area was growing (Roads, water, transport , Meds). I left that place 10 years back and recently visited my old village, to my surprise the village has become a ghost city. All youths are moving to city for jobs, Roads are vanished, Govt Medical dispensary is distroyed and replaced by some shady private health professionals. All i can see are Old people counting days.

All in all, i felt the time is going backwards and development in reverse. God saves our villages. If few villagers can do this then imagine what our central/state governments could do with their manpower and money. Majority of water problem in India is because of poor management. Nearly 2 lakh people die every year because of no water but the priorities of our governments are fucked up."

mxcj0s,,"Global press turns guns on India, blames Modi for failure to tackle second wave",Foreign Relations," Thank you global press. I do not get true info from national media.

Though there is some india bashing. I can get the facts and figures. National media is afraid to report. Modi can't come to the phone right now. Why? Oh because He is busy killing people by organizing multiple elecetion rallies and road shows. Global press is anti national 😅 Indian media busy helping Modi Election campaign At this point only foreign media and population are allowed or rather have the guts to criticize Modi. Reasons as to why blame for CoronaVirus 2nd wave is completely on Modi Government

1.	⁠They didn't allow foreign vaccines. Said we're self sufficient with Indian. Didn't allow private firms to manufacture COVIDSHIELD or COVAXIN.
2.	⁠Following above they didn't increase manufacturing capabilities. SII was under contractual obligation ; they had to send 100 million vaccines but only were able to send 18 million. Following which UK filed a lawsuit against them. For imported vaccines took praise on themselves.
3.	⁠Age cap blunder by allowing only 45+ citizens to get vaccinated. Indian Boomer population will bang thalis rather than getting a vaccine. The disinformation campaigns have been huge.
4.	⁠They didn't increase oxygen production since last year.
5.	⁠Having paid media works wonders in dissing the ground reality but when actuality spreads like fire in form of cremations, whom will you blame then?
6.	⁠Just imagine the first stock deal of vaccines India did was in Jan 21; while other nations did it back in May 20.

P.S Mandatory they were so desperate and clueless that whatever MMS said in his letter, they followed it word for word in a single day.


Edit: added additional points as mentioned by u/mayasabha 

> They didn't increase oxygen production since last year.

It took 8 months to invite bids for over 150 oxygen generation plants and most still aren't up and running in this extraordinary situation everything is running at slow pace from govt.

https://scroll.in/article/992537/india-is-running-out-of-oxygen-covid-19-patients-are-dying-because-the-government-wasted-time  Good. We need more critical foreign media eyes on the country and how indian corporations have facilitated this nincompoop. Only being shamed by goras will cause these Ambanis and Adanis and other Indian nouveau riche shake up and stop ruining this country by supporting a fascist to keep expanding their own personal wealth like russian oligarchs. Of course Modi should be blamed. He should have lead from the front. In Assam, they held rallies with impunity, even sending trains to have people come to the supreme leader's rallies. This caused a huge surge in numbers of covid cases and now my grandparents can't get the vaccine despite two attempts braving the worst. I am starting to feel the shortage real time. Is it a co-incidence that only after global media started covering india's covid scene more deeply, our gobhi started pretending that he's hard at work?

hln064,,"Madhya Pradesh’s Girl who Cycles 24-km to School Daily, Scores 98.5% in 10th Board Exams",Non-Political," Hope my mum doesn't see this > Roshni Bhadouriya, 15-year-old, lives with her family in a small village of Bhind district named Anjol. Her school was located 12 km away from home but for achieving her dreams she pedalled to and fro every day, all seasons. Sometimes, during floods she stayed at her relatives, ""I'd have to spend the night at the house of my relative. Sometimes, it would be days before I could get back home,"" she told TOI.

> She is the daughter of a farmer, Purushottam Bhadouriya who said proudly, ""All my children are good students, but this girl has made everyone proud. No one in these parts has ever scored such high marks,"" while giving an interview to TOI.

> He owns only four acres of land through which he is educating his three children. His elder son is in Class 12 and his youngest son is in Class 4.

> “It is tough with three children in today’s world, but I will not let my family have any problem. Besides, my kids are tough too.” he added. Great, kudos to you. Work hard and you'll become a successful person. Your kids will definitely hear this story for years to come if you plan to have them. "" Beta hum 24km cycle chala ke jaate the padhne tum ghar ke saamne school me to jake padh hi sakte ho"" Hats off to her. She says ""I was always attentive in class and focused on writing exactly what I had learnt"". At such a a young age, she is already methodical and more organized than me. As someone who gave most of my exams before the advent of smartphones, I feel In a way, living away from civilization can be a positive due to fewer distractions. I cannot fathom how kids are able to concentrate on studies these days. Alternate Title : Madhya Pradesh's Girl who scored 98.5% in 10th Board Exams had to cycle 24-km to School daily Can we all make a GoFundMe me page for the little superstar and build a school in her village?

1. That would be a tight slap to the Govt. for not providing the basic fundamental right to her and others like her in village. 

2. The inspiration she would be for all the girls and other children to get good grades and educate themselves out of poverty.

3. Shows that we not only upvote but can together change the lives of many bright Indian students. 

4. Create a platform for bigger role in future to provide to the needful. 

We all can do it. Unity in diversity is our core strength. Congratulations to her.. Many of the boys will be hearing soon Sharma jee ki beti ko dekho .. I’m not trying to belittle her but she’s not the only one cycling 24KM a day. She along with other kids in her village do that.

The question we should be asking is why are we in 2020 and still cannot provide a school in their own village so that they don’t have to struggle for what is essentially their right?

If she can perform at that level through this kind of struggle, imagine what she can do if she is able to apply herself more if we make schooling resources more accessible. Her kids are gonna have to hear a lot about it in the future. Yaar agar ye family group me kisine post kar dia to papa fir sunane lagenge Congratulations! :)"

But at the same time, why aren’t media houses taking it up? 
Why are international media houses covering the covid aspect in a much better way than the local ones, barring few. I can understand Republic TV tooting the horn, covering Bengal Elections and BJP rallies but what about others? Why was every media outlet instead of showing the harsh reality, focussed on Bengal? 
Govt thinks our lives aren’t worth shit but the ones given the job of questioning govt’s working are covering the elections as well while the whole country is burning. It’s just a sad state."
iek8ca,"I started volunteering at an NGO where you teach English on Call to a student from rural India for an hour a week.

I spoke to my student for the first time today, and he's about 5 months elder to me. He failed his 12th and was stuck at home, unable to work due to the lockdown.

He was telling me about his last job at a steel firm in Patna and was very proud of his work. He said he enjoyed working there and told me his personal record was having supervised the loading of 180 metric tons of material onto trucks within 12 hours and was very proud of it.

So I asked him why he quit the job, and the answer shocked me out of my bubble. He said he was the only Muslim working at the establishment, and the people he would supervise had issues taking orders from a Muslim.

His supervisors would often harass him verbally and made his job hell. This was a guy working 12 hours and was simply happy to have a job. He said he saw his boss as his elder brother and mentor (*""Mai unko bada bhai maanta hu""*) and would even now, after leaving the job, often wish him on festivals and such and the guy never replies to him or speaks well.

I felt terrible and tried to explain that sometimes it's about a lack of education and their upbringing that is faulty, to which he said that his boss was a mechanical engineer from Mumbai. Clearly educated, and clearly from an urban background.

I swear it broke my heart to see him defend his boss and his peers even though they harassed him out of his job for simply being a Muslim.

How do I apologise to him for what happened? How do I tell him that not everyone is like this? How do I tell him that it gets better?

Fuck your hate-mongering politicians, fuck your Hindustani Bhau, and fuck your communalism.

&#x200B;

Edit: for people who want to volunteer as well,  [https://www.learnoncall.in/](https://www.learnoncall.in/)   
It's a great initiative, and feels really good to talk to these children and teach them with the personal attention that they've never received before. 

Edit 2: A few people reported that the WhatsApp group is full. I spoke to someone who works there who has ensured that they've made another group and the Google form has been updated with it. On that note, a disclaimer: I'm just a volunteer with no relations to the NGO itself. If you'd like to get in touch with them, you can find contact details on tje link above :D",How can educated Indians be so uneducated?,Politics," Is there something similar but for volunteers who only speak English? Can I become an instructor for that NGO? All that high class education didn't teach us morals. Sigh. Having a degree and being educated are not the same or else why would a Harvard returned garland lynching accused? Indians at the most learn some skills in colleges and universities, skills with which they can earn a living. Skill != Education. Despite going to universities, most Indians remain absolutely stupid, superstitious, religious, casteist and communal. Check the qualification of all these Whatsapp uncles and you would see that each of those idiots are at least graduate. Was shocked in a similar fashion when one of my neighbour asked my mother not to buy fruits and veggies from a Muslim vendor. I asked him the reason and I was told that they spit on items and then sell. I gave him a ""go fuck yourself"" look and we continue to buy stuffs till date. 

The guy who told me is a lawyer (or liar. Sounds same though). I'm surprised to see how this sick mentality has grown so deep into the society. I'm glad that I still go for Eid feasts but unfortunately my friends stopped coming for Chhath Puja Prasad all because of these morons in my colony.

Edit: I didn't mean all lawyers🙏 There was once an ad initiative by Nagpur police on it's street once. 
It read ' well educated but not well cultured ' I think it's holds so true in today's  time. Tell him his ex boss is not a good guy...there is quiet a big difference between education and proper education and sure the upbringing matters. Also not everyone is like this ex-boss. Give yourself as an example. Tell him to confront whenever he feels oppressed. Its still a democratic country and every single human in this country has the power to decide whats right and wrong for him/her. Shying away from things will only do good for those bosses not for himself... Fucking hell. I swear sometimes humans and their stupidity makes me angry.

A kid who doesn't know any hate or religious bias being subjected to all this is just unfathomable to me yet this happens everyday. I don't see any hope. Be there for him please and let him know its them, always them and not him. Also, let him know that there's no need to waste his energy wishing people like these or even communicating. Unfortunately, Islamophobia is steadily growing in India, all thanks to communal politics and godi media running Hindu-Muslim debates day & night. Not too long ago, Muslims were getting more acceptable in the society, Infact I'll go on to say that very few Hindus had any problem with Muslims. That's changing though, all thanks to the hate politics going on in our country. Thank you for making this post. I just found something I can volunteer for during these covid times. Theres a difference between wanting to be educated for the education and wanting to be educated to get money. 


Almost like there is difference between getting laid for sex and getting laid to earn money.

Among the two,the ones who get educated to get money are more prone to having no dignity and being depraved and evil."

Thanks in advance sanitarypanels is always very brave I have been questioning that why did bjp accelerate the covid by its political interests and not afraid of covid infecting themselves, then I came to realise that these are the people that no matter what happens will never die, I am pretty sure these people would have arranged vaccine and oxygen cylinders even for there part time drivers. They know this that's why they had no qualms in organising rallies because they know that even if every one contracts covid in there rallies only a small percentage will die and they just need enough votes to win the election. The deaths can never be traced directly back to them and those who do point at them ,there IT cell will deal with them. 
They are literally treating people like rearing cattles who will give them votes  and if not then they will let lose there dogs to round them up and terrorise them.

Most of them know deep down how fucked up the situation is in India but they'll double down on their decision to back the government as they think humiliation in accepting the truth is worse than just shoving both fingers in your ears and just pivot on any topic that is controversial.

Rhea was a vent for everyone. She was a vent for SSR's family because they had to lash out at someone and who better than his gf they didn't approve of. She was a vent for the media cause it proved to be the perfect distraction. She was a vent for Bihar so they can rile up votes for their elections. She was a vent for the incels of our nation since how dare a decent looking independant woman take weed and live with her bf without being married. She was a vent for the covid struck janta who are losing their jobs and livelihood cause they had to channel their frustrations somewhere and venting on the government means admitting you were wrong.

Everyone knows it and no one wants to admit it. Everyone loves to see someone even slightly more successful than themself fall. So everyone is jumping ship now. Arnab ke lag gaye pakode?

She might have had her reasons to be in that toxic environment, but that doesn't absolve her of her guilt. Did she get a bearing on her moral compass once a bengali woman got victimised by the very news channel she works for? Jabtak khudka gaand mein aag nahi jalega, tabtak kisiko kuch farak nahi parega

But then again, better late than never Abhi ayegana maja bhidu Most of us here would have some views. Some of us who hate the propaganda machine called republic TV will call this bullshit because she was part of it for such a long time and helped spread the poison, will judge her, without knowing her own viewpoint or circumstances which made her stay their. But then how are these people different than the people who are abusing and accusing Rhea.

While the would be others who be showering praise on her for being brave and rising her career and even life. Which may even be true or maybe there is some personal agenda behind it.

The point amn trying to make it, is about time we all get off our high house and stop judging people without knowing the full truth and they from others point of view. And if we can't, then atleast stop spreading the hate and angst in this already toxic situation. So she was okay with all the bigotry on Republic TV all these years?

India against Corruption was promising until it exposed itself as a tool to uproot INC regime. But it did show that the people of country can push for reforms. Though the movement was a failure, it displayed the loopholes the political elite exploit to silence reforms. 

With no party worthy of support, our dissent, protest should therefore be in support of reforms rather plain opposition of the ruling regime. Our dissent should be coupled with pressure on electoral/institutional reforms. 
There are many people/societies/unions/citizen groups who have been shouting for these reforms, we should join them. After all, the executive and legislature rule by mood of nation! The attack on the Constitution is so blatant right now, it's not even funny. The fact that we study the Independence struggle in school for years and still somehow, divide and rule works.

As they say ""Tyranny of Majority"" I don't live in India, but I visit often and am of Indian decent, but one key element of most Indian societies is what I like to call;

Punch Down mentality.

People, be they politicians, teachers, bus drivers or parents never step to authority or speak truth to power. They instead opt to attack those on the step under them on the power ladder.

That's no recipe for success.

I think Games will also be censored soon just like China. Everything will be controlled from social media to news portals. You'll only see what they want you to see. This is what they're planning after the toolkit drama. An *internal* fantasy world will be made eventually. 

Reddit will be fucked pretty soon too. Lol. Back to piracy.

If people starts unsubscribing from netflix and amazon now, maybe the companies will take steps. I am worried about horror and action since on tv they cut a lot of stuff, and sometimes what they cut is essential to the story, but is too violent (too violent according to the censor board that is) so I guess this is what ""digital India"" was about huh.

* Finally gave baba 2-3Lakh in front of a camera(ofc) and kept acting like he's doing baba a very big favor.  
  
Hope he's arrested tbh Why can't we have one feel good story in this country without it being tarnished someway or the other? Its not the Baba's video only. 

If you see the Youtuber's channel, he has been milking donations in the name of many such poor and old aged couple.

https://www.youtube.com/c/Swadofficial/videos

I mean even on a small forum like redditindia overnight we can easily collect 2-3 lakhs for a legitimate cause.

Now imagine how much money was collected over Baba ka Dhaba video, as it went viral all over India. Personal account. He's also very rude. He talked to my friend about video editing for his channel. After my friend shared his price, this youtuber said ""Tu janta hai mai kaun hu?"" The deal then got cancelled, obviously. But this is not the way you speak to people. He used his own bank account instead of Baba’s. That itself shows that Wasan had fraud intentions I got downvoted to hell when i said on original tweets  that he himself has not set the gpay and other accounts. All the money was going into someone else account and you don't get to know if he donated your money or not. 

Those guys were telling me i am narrow minded and insulting me everywhere. Where are you guys now. 

This world is rotten,  i told ya if you want to help them go by yourself or with the friends or family who lives there.  Online donations sucks. This country has a massive integrity deficit. It's alarming that so many people are thieves even after making enough to have a decent quality of life. No one wants to address and acknowledge this issue because every second guy is making stuff up for monetary gain - one with false receipts at his office, another is siphoning off donor funds from a viral post, the third is lying to a friend so he can get rid of some useless shit for a good price, etc And this guy as a proof showed bank statement in excel sheet which had transactions of zero amount and even transaction ID's were repeating.

And there's another famous youtube named gauravzone who has nothing to do with this scam but still getting hate in instagram and youtube because people are mistaking his name🤦‍♂️.  Kanta Prasad, the 80-year-old owner of Delhi's Baba Ka Dhaba eatery, has filed a complaint against Instagram influencer Gaurav Wasan for misappropriation of funds, police said on Sunday. He alleged that Wasan ""intentionally and deliberately shared only his and his family/friends bank details and mobile numbers with the donors and collected huge amount of donation through different mode of payments"".

hp7qzh,,Black Lives Matter I African nationals in India complain of being treated like second class citizens,Politics," Most Indians think like this :

""When racism is directed towards Indians it is bad. But when Indians discriminate against others, it is clearly based on good reasons or was *not intended that way*. It is different saar"". Second class doesn't even justify it.
It's third class.

I wonder how they survive in India. There are quite a few African origin people in mumbai..not sure where they get employed.
The stereotype i know is that they are into drugs or some shady business even when they could be doing legitimate jobs.

I hope their kids are not harassed in schools and are treated respectfully.

I would hate for my kid to be discriminated against because of his ethnicity /skin color. 

I hope things get better for them.
I know there are quite a few Indians in Africa. They would hate to be treated the way Indians treat Africans here.. Difference being racism is a recognized issue in the whole world, in india racism is ""natural"" as ""natural"" as your own mother telling you to stop playing outside so much due to getting dark or judging a person by their complexion. Sick. I'm just spent a year in a West African country. I was in a town of 30k people and somehow there was a community of indians there. They were there for a chemical company that owned the local plant. The attitude from the indians there of the locals was horrible. Name-calling, Racist views, degrading locals who didn't speak English (which is not their national language so they have no obligation to speak English). I was honestly ashamed to be seen as the same as them. They were there purely for business and I was there as a separate entity, learning about their culture, learning their language etc. I hope I was able to show the locals that not all Indians are racist A**holes. If you are black, you do get a treated like a 3rd class citizen. My wife is of darker complexion then me. At my wedding my mom made a comment ""she's not as fair as you. You could've gotten a better girl"". I almost walkout of that wedding because I don't appreciate that and would rather marry in court.  That mentality needs to fucking go away. India might be the most racist country in the world. Indians discriminate against their own people. My sister told me her Vietnamese classmate (highschool) got beat up in Bangalore when they went out for groceries by a group of people. claiming they have covid19. The state of this country rn is baffling Skin care products need I say more. Even celebrities like Yami Gautam, Alia Bhatt, Sharukh Khan, Kiara Advani, etc. This list is long and I can't even list out all the names. Yeah and white people are given preference over Black people for making ads. Forget about Africans, we treat our own countrymen as second class citizens based on religion, caste & gender, way to many problems but zero solutions. They are right to complain. We're equally bad as current gen white racists. This is very true.We suck up to white tourists and favour them  even if they hardly spend anything and look down and behave very rudely with africans, Chinese, and east asians .It is very visible in Goa restaurants and resorts too.Indians have to wait for ages  while the whites waltz in .I have heard Africans .called Kalia (black)  by Indians darker than them.It is very disgusting."
n4ex0a,"I've seen forwards in a couple of groups that ask to adopt small children whose parents have passed away due to Covid.

Some forwards also have the phone number of the caretaker of the children.

This is a very heartbreaking situation for the children, but for the sake of these children, do not forward such messages.

There are a lot of vultures who prey on children to traffic them.

That's why there are so many checks and stringent rules before adoption.

Unfortunately, it is a sad situation, but at the same time, such messages are dangerous for these very kids.

The extended family/neighbours/the concerned people of these babies should go through the established channels for this…

This is so sad, and I had never thought that I'd be typing these words ever in my life…",Please don't forward messages about adopting children of parents who have died due to Covid,Coronavirus," * [Covid-19 Megathread for Discussions is live here>>](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIndia/comments/mr3v1d/coronavirus_covid19_megathread_news_and_updates_8/)

Spot on. Same goes for restrictions on adopting Indian children by foreigners or NRIs.

While we may be tempted to do our bit by clicking and forwarding such messages, even we may not remember the consequences of our actions 6 months or 6 years from now. The children will have to live through it.

Also keep in mind in most cases, families (or extended families) should have the first right of refusal. Yes that's what I was thinking In any case, adoptions in India can legally be done through CARA only. There is a due process for doing so. Nobody can adopt a child just like that without registering with CARA (Central Adoption Resource Authority) first. >Please don't forward messages about adopting children of parents who have died ~~due to Covid~~ Please dial 1098 and report such cases.  These posts asking for adoption are illegal. To create awareness:


Direct adoption of an orphaned child is illegal and a punishable offence.  

If you hear of an orphaned child, call 1098. 

Adopt a child legally. To know more about legal adoption, log on to www.cara.nic.in or dial 0361-2229275 #ChildAdoption

DO NOT believe social media posts for adopting children  orphaned because of COVID-19 What? Are people doing this? This is completely illegal. Not to mention there are entire procedures you have to comply with. The kid needs to be surrendered/abandoned and declared as such by the CWC, there are inquiries and investigations, then the kid is officially declared free for adoption under the Juvenile Justice Act, and THEN the adoptive parents might get the kid, depending on whether they meet the criteria set out under the Adoption Regulations 2017. Anything else will amount to trafficking. I honestly never thought that people would do something like this. God, this sends shivers down my spine. I'm so sorry that this is happening. So fucking awful! Will keep an eye out for these messages.

I hope the kids are safe. Is there anything we can do to ensure their safety? 

Can I please share your post on my WhatsApp and IG to spread awareness? This is very true. Orphaned children need to be taken care of through the proper means and are not something that can be handed out through social media forwards ffs. It is very upsetting that India lacks any such channels or proper means, but we must at least take the responsibility to find such means and let anyone who needs it know. who dafuq does that , oh your car broke at midnight lemme give strangers your address so they can pick you up"

### TLDR

A whistleblower provided us with a cache of blocking orders for more than 4000 websites issued in India. We are making them available online as they form an essential resource for the public and researchers. As per our initial analysis a majority of website blocking being done due to copyright claims and court orders.

### Public Disclosure : reducing secrecy and opacity

Website blocking is a complex issue which seems to be growing in severity only with time. Ordinary Indians who access the internet --- which is a public resource -- still do not know the reason why a specific website is blocked. Sometimes, even the persons who run these websites do not have knowledge as to the reasons and the legal authority which has directed the blocking of websites.

We have earlier explained the legal position in respect of [**porn websites**](https://internetfreedom.in/whattheblock/), how sometimes [**blocking is inconsistently done at the ISP level**](https://internetfreedom.in/what-the-block-iff-has-heard-your-complaints-and-is-taking-action-savetheinternet/), and done a preliminary analysis of the s[**everal orders we had received through RTIs**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-tale-of-rogue-pirates-ashok-kumars-and-isps-caught-in-the-middle-rti-data-on-court-ordered-website-blocking-reveals-worrying-trends-whattheblock/). Our continuing attempts to increase transparency around this issue received a boost. A whistleblower has [**provided orders**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XtWN1FGTnalCIOiEdCLtIbuGM-d_3IYR?usp=sharing) sent by courts and government authorities to Internet Service Providers across India. These contain more than 64 documents and provide explanations for the blocking of about 4398 websites. Today we are publishing them for public knowledge and the wider research community.

### Preliminary inferences

We have three preliminary inferences to share on these orders. While offering these inferences we would like to point out that this is a limited data set and is likely to display a bias given the total data field of all blocking orders is not publicly available. At the same time we find value in providing an initial analysis that confirms several points on the reasons for blocking, or the more recent instance of how the [**WeTransfer block** ](https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-the-dot-to-unblock-wetransfer-whattheblock/)was effected without proper transparency.

* **Courts are primary actors:** The public authorities from which most of these orders arise are from courts situated in Delhi and Chennai. This is principally the High Court of Delhi and the High Court of Madras. The nature of the orders are interim injunctions on claims by content owners. Here quite often file sharing and movie streaming websites are being blocked. Here processes for specific takedowns on URLs is not the preferred route but entire websites are blocked. A casual read through the list of URLs confirms this.
* **Website blocking is inconsistent:** Internet users all across India who use different ISPs have very different experiences on website blocking. This may be due to the technology used, the nature of blocking that is affected and varies from each ISPs compliance in each specific region where they may be offering services through a different technical infrastructure. This is specifically through Document No. 59 which is a non-compliance report in which correspondence was specifically directed to ISPs to block websites in terms of an earlier order.
* **Lack of opposition and transparency:** Despite the large impression carried that a majority of blocking orders are affected by Government, as stated these primarily occur through infringement claims made by private parties. In most of these cases the defendants are a few websites, ISPs and Government Departments. It is not clear whether any opposition is presented and whether a high level of scrutiny is visited prior to the directions for blocking being made. While many of such claims may be legitimate there do exist legitimate arguments on proportionality and how over-broad intellectual property enforcement results in deprivations of the public’s right to access materials online. This issue is further compounded by the insufficient notice to people as there does not exist any central, or government repository for housing and publishing their directions for blocking websites.

### The Tanul Thakur Case

We have identified that it is a lack of proactive publication and transparency in India’s blocking process whether through courts or executive bodies which is causing a fracture of public trust in the exercise of this power. At present there is a writ petition pending before the High Court of Delhi regarding the blocking of the satirical website, “[**Dowry Calculator**](https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-the-government-for-blocking-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/)”.

We have been working with Tanul Thakur, the petitioner and the creator of this website since May, 2019 with drafting and filing RTI applications and we also assisted with the writ petition. Our hope through this intervention is that it helps support greater transparency and the norms of proper notice to website creators, hearings in which they can put forward a defence followed by a public disclosure of the decision. You can read more about this case here, from when [**notice was first issued**](https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-the-government-for-blocking-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/), to the [**stand taken by the government**](https://internetfreedom.in/meity-defends-blocking-of-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/). As always, IFF is committed towards working relentlessly towards protecting your digital rights.

There was a [post about it on this sub](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/hg0gcs/can_we_talk_about_the_fact_that_the/) a day back.  

On the one hand this is at least better than their old strategy of banning the entire domain but this on platforms like Reddit is not ideal because Subs are basically their own separate communities with their own peculiar sub-cultures. It is like blocking a site in that way. The number of 123movies sites they block is crazy but what's more crazier now they keep coming back xD So. Many. Bookmark-able. Websites ;) [deleted] I remember the Supreme Court categorically stated that only specific infringing URLs can be blocked in one of its orders.

How are the High Courts diverging from that? Also, why can't India implement a transparent takedown framework?

Also, do ordinary third parties (like Indian residents) have standing to appeal against such an order?

Is IFF planning some kind of PIL to bring this to the notice of the Supreme Court, and perhaps push for a DMCA-like takedown notice?

I know that the DMCA is not perfect, but it is much better than the censorship alternative.

Also, while I understand that the courts are responsible for blocking websites, the Supreme Court reportedly stated that an individual who watches adult content in the privacy of his dwelling (not in verbatim) cannot be adjudged guilty of violating Indian obscenity laws. What basis does a lower court have in blocking websites which take compliance with the law seriously? List of website starts from document 28. Thank you Internet Freedom Foundation. Please keep your hard work in protecting open internet. I wish more people recognizes the importance of organizations like you, especially at the time where every government tries to oppress people, truth and freedom.

Edit: Please donate to IFF if you can. wasn't our country proud that we don't censor stuff like China does, what now? This is just dumb, blocking porn websites to satirical websites to even subreddits like r/NSFW and r/indiansgonewild.  
Not cool man, not cool. Maybe they will ban this comment for criticizing them? RTI being killed on one side and then websites being blocked No chance of representation, show cause notice is really a travesty of justice. Courts take decades to decide ciminal cases but are too quick to jump on satire and porn (which is a legal grey area). Not what I was expecting on that huge list!"

hu0r30,,This grocery store in Kerala’s Ernakulam uses zero plastic,Non-Political," If only Coke hadn't gone the plastic route and we consumers manipulated, we hadn't come to this. 

I'd highly recommend [Coca-Cola's plastic secrets \(2019\)](https://youtu.be/-I9S9Sv2dU4). 

It talks about the book Citizen Coke and Coke's environmental strategy particularly from the 60s when plastic began to revolutionize consumer society and how they partnered with an org called Keep America Beautiful whose main aim was to tell consumers, ""They're the bad ones, they're the litter bugs. Industry shouldn't be blamed for this plastic waste."" This was how the Keep America Beautiful campaign with a Red Indian became a huge success. As an American who is astounded at the amount of plastic I personally consume as well as see consumed in my country, this was so refreshing on my visit to Kerala. When shopping, my goods were always placed in paper bags or simple cloth bags. I still use them almost a year later. Useful as well as a nice reminder of my trip. This is perfect. We need something like this in every city Plastic bags are banned in Kerala and this led to shopowners finding alternatives like this. Go Ernakulam! r/zerowaste This is so inspiring. Kerela mein hi hona tha yeh... It'll be great to have these in other metropolitans as well. I got to India every 3-4 years and early 2020 when I went it was amazing how they cut most plastic out. Deliveries were almost with no plastic even the forks wouldn't be. Stores would have non plastic bags. 

It was a HUGE improvement, and way better than most other Asian countries I travel in where plastic is still somewhat common even if officially banned for big retailers. 

And if I recall the govt didn't even implement the law banning plastic, but just the threat caused these delivery and food comps to change their practices. [deleted] Be like Bitu What’s the name of this grocery store?"
m62khd,"I used to work in a govt bank, but am still a part of the WhatsApp group of that particular batch. I remember fuming and feeling sad after reading incredibly hateful messages and stuff like that from right wing members, last year.

It happened during that tabligi jamaat thing, with many of these educated intellectuals posting fake forwards from years before, of people spitting on vegetables and fruits. They were also quite active during the early stages of Kisaan andolan, and had zero issues with calling them terrorists and antinationals.

Now, finally when they are on the receiving end, these nuts are against the govt. Still there are a few in that group who aren't openly critical of govt., and at the same time are in full support of the banker strikes.

The key quality of a right wing supporter all over the world including India is selfishness. They simply don’t care about the others. Everything is reasonable if they benefit from it. Everything isn’t if they don’t. Is this about privatization of the banks? The way modi media works, explains how angrez manage to fuck our own ass beneath our own nose Can't wait till they start writing to Ravish Kumar to hear and cover their story. Schadenfreude is the best feeling in the world :)

Make sure you pretend to be an absolute bhakt on the whatsapp group. Write on the group calling all these bank strike supporters ""anti-nationals"", and about how Modi is being super kind and generous by allowing them to carry on these protests.

Also add all the other  usual stuff - about how strikes are undemocratic because the govt is democratically elected and it can do whatever it wants till the next election, about how the privatisation of the banks should at least be given a chance, about how ""agar Modi ne kiya hoga to kuch soch kar hi kiya hoga"", how the Congress is behind these strikes, how it is all a conspiracy, how all the strikers are getting Rs 500 and biryani every day, where is the money for all this biryani coming from - Pakistan?, about how Shaheen Bagh Dadi has been seen with the strikers, how if these bank strikers don't like it here in India, they should go to Pakistan.

Assert confidently that there is a dark global conspiracy - the striking bankers are in cahoots with farmers, Khalistanis, Muslims, Tableeghis, spitting vegetable vendors, love jihadis, anti-Modi media, global organisations that claim India is less free now, Moody's, ISI, beef-eaters, and JNU students. Yeah I know the feeling, have many sikh friends who were openly sharing anti Muslim posts on instagram during the whole anti CAA Shaheen Bagh protests and then on Tablighi jamaat demonization by media, it's very fun to see them criticizing BJP now. [deleted] At this point we are all anti nationals. the one peculiar thing about us indians is that we get united in our hatred for anything. We'll bitch about it continuously with our peers and friends just to keep things 'friendly'. Until of course that 'thing' actually happens to us. We're too comfortable with being comfortable. We avoid hard conversations to keep things 'cool'. Well in the name of 'tafri' things started to get political and here we are.

Every person who was there ran away because police didn't really care about them. Only money left which 7-8 lakhs in cash and few gold chains. Police siezed it all. Next day in newspaper it was reported that police siezed only 25000 rupees. Lmao. The best episode of this type was when the police caught some guys who had stolen some mobile phones. Of course, they filed report, confiscated whatever phones the guys had, arrested the guys etc.etc. But somehow they were unable to recover all the stolen mobiles. 

 Much later it seems that few of the still missing phones got activated and it was revealed  that the junior constables had ""gifted"" them to their senior officers without disclosing the actual source of the ""gifts""! Lot of red faces all around! Summoning NCB.......let them go to jail for being part of a ""drug syndicate"".      
Shame if this doesn't happen.    
If Bollywood stars can't escape, why should your servicemen xd Baniye ka dimaag aur dalli police ki daring... Rest of maal has  been sent to Arnab I guess. Due to his special demand of drugs. Isse Accha toh legalise Kar do...atleast economy ka Kuch bhala hoga Looks like they smoked that gaanja while creating the delhi riots chargesheet guys I'm no expert but this sounds more than 59 grams.

Does this mean Delhi police are ""active members of a drug syndicate""? > The ganja was kept concealed beneath other goods, was worth Rs 20 crore.

Fuck. No wonder delhi postings are next to impossible. So this happened to me a couple of years ago. I was scoring from one of the peddlers near my area, and he asked me to wait for some time. So me and my friend were standing in the gully entrance where the peddlers house was. After 5-10 mins I see a couple of grown men come out of their house. 
One of them sees us and asks what are we doing here. I told him I am here to meet a friend, and then he said ""beta police walo ko sab pata hota hai"" and laughed a bit. I fucking shit my pants,but maintained my composure and just said hey you know about this haha (literally). He told us to focus on studies and leave that place and never come back lalala. I obliged religiously,for like ten mins. When we went back again the peddler told me that those guys took 15000 bucks as ghoos and it's like a monthly thing.. ""aap maal lo tension nahi"" ..what a guy. Used to sell shit weed tho fuck that peddler ol Mera desh badal raha hai"
myshgv,"Modi govt has ordered twitter to remove a lot of posts that expose the state of COVID19 crisis in the country. As a result , Twitter has removed these posts that show the true image of what is actually going on in the country. Pictures of mass cremations, burials, people dying on the roads waiting for oxygen etc. 

Why is Twitter, a US Company aiding the Modi government in covering up its crimes? Especially right during a humanitarian crisis. Are Americans OK with this? Are Americans fine with knowing an American company is assisting genocide caused by Modi govt's negligence? It is a matter of national shame that a US company is casually enabling dictators to thrive. 

Twitter must be made answerable. US Congress have asked Twitter to testify multiple times in the past. Now it must answer why they are so keen on coming to Modi's rescue. Is profit the only goal, over every moral and ethical duty? 

Modi cannot ban Twitter from India, it would amount to violations under International Trade Laws that India is a signatory to, WTO/ UN law, right to free and fair trade, and Twitter if forcefully banned in India can claim compensation and legally enforce their rights (similar to what Amazon did when Reliance-Future Group connived to rob Amazon, Amazon enforced their rights via a Singapore court). 

Just because a dictator ordered Twitter to remove some posts doesnt mean Twitter must actually assist in covering up evidence of Modi's crimes. Twitter, being a US company, must be responsible for its actions and though it wont give answers to Indians, it should be answerable to Americans and the US Legislature.","Indians living in USA, Indian-Americans and US Citizens: Please ask your Congressmen and Senators to hold Twitter to task for helping Modi cover up COVID19 Crimes",Foreign Relations," I don't think USA will do anything against the Indian govt.India is their main ally in the strategic plans against China and Russia.

A bad move from USA will make India choose the other side. And USA wouldn't want that right now when their global influence is in question. You are right, but it think twitter has no balls to stand the ground cos they fear India might ban twitter cos they banned Tik-tok which was at the time most used app in the world . They are afraid of loosing millions of users. But putting pressure on them will show twitter's double face to world. [deleted] Regardless of the tech company, if you want to do business in India, you need to be in good books with Modi. 

Its akin to paying ""hafta"" to the local bhai. Sad to see this practice being operated at national level and for the whole world to see. Hey dude, I heard YouTube is doing the same, I have seen many channels making a community post that their videos are getting down, like you can check a channel named official peeinghuman, he made a community post yesterday about that, check it out Might be different for you guys, but every NRI uncle I've met has a huge boner for Fodi and think he can do no wrong.

n1o3hr,,Petition for Modi to Resign.,Politics," Lol, man petitions don't work in India. Vote them out in 2024. I don't think petitions work. However, I also think signing this is a good idea, if it happens in large numbers. Politics is an optics game and a constant nail to Modi's approval is the way to go right now. BJP had figured out a long time back that pushing constant approval fosters and brings in real approval back. Most people opposing Modi, in their infinite wisdom, underestimate the power of constant hammering. Doing something is better than doing nothing.... the general elections won't happen till 2024 but this issue needs to brought to the forefront. Modi's government is responsible for these needless deaths. Im aware that these petitions aren’t very effective. But immense support can bring this issue more clearly to world view. Sorry,as someone from malaysia,but did my mbbs in india,my heart goes to all of my batchmates who are frontliners and are themselves seeking help for their own parents.

mb7yny,"Hey!

Sex and Sexual Education barely/never gets talked about in India. I'm a 26F who's been sexually active since the last 5 years. Whatever I've learned, has been from girl-friends, experience, porn (SEX IS 294739% DIFFERENT FROM PORN) and erotica novels

There are SO so many things I wish I knew *before*.....or wish I didn't have to learn from experience. Hence I've made this post for all my fellow women, men, and everyone in between.

This post is written from a woman's  POV but I **strongly advice everyone to read it** regardless of gender and orientation.

**Trigger warning** \- There are mentions of Sexual and mental trauma in this post. But specific points regarding them have NOT been mentioned and I hope to make a specific post about that one day 
Child and Sexual abuse COMPLETELY change a person's perspective of sex and it has to be dealt with appropriately. If you have been abused in any way, there are chances that it has changed/affected you and you don't even know.

**Terminology -**

Skinship - Any kind of sexual touching

Kissing - Lip to lip kissing

1st base - Boob/butt groping

2nd base - Groin groping

3rd base - Oral

Home run -  Sex

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chapter 1 - **When is the right time to start having sex**

When you FEEL like it and when you are 100% sure.

The first time I had sex, it was crap. I wasn't sure if I wanted to have sex. I was confused about whether I was ready for the act, whether he was the one, whether I'd regret it later. (I went back to the hostel and cried)

And guess what? If you're having these kind of thoughts or doubts YOU ARE PROBABLY **NOT** READY.

Being nervous is normal. But being unsure or hesitant usually means you need more time.

Sex is as *mental* as physical (especially for women), what I mean by this is to PHYSICALLY enjoy sex, you need to be turned on MENTALLY.

If you are worried/not sure/not turned on, its not going to be as fun as its supposed to.

The above applies to all kinds of skinship.

Do it if you are **ready** and want to do it **with the person**. (both equally important)

Age usually doesn't matter BUT I strongly advice you to be **older than 18** (no less than 16 please) because being sexually active *does* open up the chances of trauma and I would never wish my 16/17 year old self to experience the same things I did at 21+ (actually I wouldn't want ANYONE and ANY AGE to get trauma but as an older person I was better equipped to handle something like that)

&#x200B;

My first relationship was in 10th standard. First time I held hands with a boy (romantic sense). Didn't progress more than that

My second relationship was in 12th - First time romantic hugging. I eventually let him touch my butt. Didn't progress beyond that

My first kiss was at 19 with a college boyfriend

My first first/second base when I was 20

My first time sex at 21

&#x200B;

You are **never too late** to do any kind of skinship. But **you can be EARLY**.

**Do not be pressured into anything! Not even holding hands!**

Bollywood shows its okay to forcibly hold her hand and ""Haseena maan jayegi"", that girls are just ""shy"" so if you ""push enough"" itll be fine.

NO! If you aren't ready, if skinship makes you unhappy then don't do it.

Be a ""prude"". Be ""backward"". Be ""boring"". But you'll be happy and **that is worth hell more**.

(I learnt this the hard way and I wish you don't have to)

If you are in a relationship and your significant other is pushing you, tell them why you aren't ready. Tell them what you feel inside. Be honest. If they do actually like/love you, they'll wait.

If they don't wait/shame/pressure/force you **BREAK UP**. That's a big red flag. They care about more their *physical want* instead of your *mental health*.

After my first time I went back to my hostel and cried. I regretted it instantly. Broke up with the guy

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chapter 2 - **CONSENT**

Now that you have decided that you are ready for skinship and ready with a particular person, how do you go about it?

**TALK!** Communication is the best thing you can do in this situation. Its going to be awkward, its going to be embarrassing, you'll be shy, but if you communicate throughout it, you'll get over the above hurdles and it'll actually be fun!

**If you are initiating**, best thing you can do is ***ask***

""Hey can I hold your hand?/I'm going to hold your hand now?"" ""I'm going to kiss you. Are you fine with it?""

When your partner tells you yes, it'll be the best feeling in the world.

**If they aren't ready yet**, leave it alone at that moment and *later* ask them what's wrong and how to get over it. Don't be embarrassed! The fact that you initiated is commendable enough. Honestly there is so much baggage and emotion involved in skinship, you need to give the other person time.

Communication, **figuring out what's going on together** is the best thing to do.

And eventually when you do DO something, it'll be worth it 2648372 times more (*emotions make skinship a million times better*)

Remember to talk about WHAT (are you going to do), WHEN and WHERE< more about this below

You can do the above via text/written form if you aren't comfortable verbally asking someone. (it's not lame at all. it's actually much easier lol)

Girls can initiate too! It **DOESN'T** make you a ""whore/slut/easy/used"" or some other misogynistic bullshit adjective.

&#x200B;

**If your partner is initiating**

You are ready - Say yes! Talk about it! What are your limits, when, where and what etc

Encourage them by reciprocating their touch, talk to them about what feels good and what doesn't!

Eg: Tell them you want a hug but aren't read for kisses...yet.

**IT'S IMPORTANT to talk about WHAT**. Consent doesn't mean you are ready to do anything and everything. You need to talk about your limits. What base you are okay with going. What you aren't.

If you are going beyond kisses, **WHERE** is important (its India you can't and shouldn't do things in public places for your own safety)

&#x200B;

If you aren't ready - **say No! But explain why too!** Talk with each other! Tell them why you said no (if you explain it'll take the sting of rejection away and also educate them for future endeavours with you or other people)

A good partner will wait, understand and help you work through  your thoughts and issues.

&#x200B;

If you said yes but things are going beyond your limit and you're scared/uncomfortable **you CAN SAY NO.** You CAN stop in the middle of a makeout session if your partners hands are going south and you aren't ready for it.

You CAN say no if you are lying naked in bed and on 3rd base but aren't ready for sex yet.

**YOU. CAN. SAY. NO.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

CHAPTER 3 - **First time**

You're ready, you have your person, you both know what you are going to do. What's next?

sexxyyyyyy timezzzzzzzz

Your first time is GOING to be *awkward.* < Any kind of skinship 

(my first hug I just patted the guy on his back and he said he felt like he was hugging his grandpa)

There is **noooooothing wrong** with being awkward. Even with being BAD.

I mean c'mon. If it took you a few years to start walking without falling on your face, it can take you 2/3 kisses to figure out what to do with your lips!

Your first hug you won't know what to do with your hands. Your first kiss you won't know what to do with your lips and your first home run you wont know what to do with anything

**IT'S. O.K**

Skinship is like any other skill. **You'll have to learn it**, and it gets better with ""practice"" (sadly I still don't know how to hug)

My first kiss I felt like a fish and was disgusted by touching someone else's saliva (I still can't and won't use tongue in kissing because its so bfkdhfksjhjh)

ALL OF IT will be bfkdhfksjhjh you just have to find out which bfkdhfkshjhjh you *like* and want to do again and again

I took a year to move from 1st base to 2nd base with my partner. We spent a YEAR just making out and touching bewbs before he touched my vagene

and thats O.K!

We had become masters in lip touching and when we moved to 2nd base we were back to not knowing anything and learning.

Every step of skinship will be **another learning curve**. But believe me, it'll be fun (if you're ready and with the right person)

(I'll keep repeating if **you're ready** and with the **right** person again and again because thats the MOST important thing about skinship)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chapter 4 - **Media of sex**

If you go into sex after watching porn or reading romantic novels. You WILL be **disappointed**.

**Sex is NOTHING like porn. Or even erotica novels** 

&#x200B;

**PORN**

After watching Indian movie hero do you think every guy can beat up million goons and flip a car? No right?

Same with porn!

Sex is not as easy, as seamless and as........ ""sexy"" as porn shows.

Sex is awkward positions. Body hair.  Sweating. Sore muscles. Sore genitals (YES you heard me right VAGENES AND PEPES get SORE AFTER SEX)

You'll come in 30seconds. You won't come at all. You'll get tired. You'll have to pee in the middle THAT is what sex is

Your one touch WON'T get your partner moaning. Your partner won't jump down to their knees as soon as they see you and give you head

SHOWER SEX IS A SCAM 

Height differences matter

Movies are to daily life what porn is to real sex

(once a guy asked me why my boobs arent working because my boob tips didn't harden the moment he touched me lol)

Addition by u/Atomik_cow about Porn addiction 
""Guys, if your ding dong isn’t cooperating on stage, stop porn altogether. This is especially relevant for Indian men because sexual encounters don’t come too easily. Porn simulates the rush of being with multiple partners in multiple situations (multiple browser tabs open). Reality can't compete with the novelty and variety of porn. If you’re getting all stimulation in the privacy of your room, you may feel less inclined to improve yourself and be social.

Putting yourself out there comes with a risk of rejection. Porn addiction is very very real. It affects you in several other ways as well. Simply put, our brain wants to get 'high'. This 'high' makes it feel like it has hit the evolutionary jackpot. If you're able to sustain this high by sitting at home, alone in your room, and browsing for hours, you will never feel the need to go out.

Imagine a situation where your friends invited you to a club, a place where people socialize and have fun. If you sit at home and fap, you're likely to cancel the plan because you've already got your 'high' without the need to spend money, socialize and all that. If you did go to the club, imagine standing alone in a corner feeling anxious and just wanting to get back home (to your computer).

Socializing takes effort. Knowing how to dance takes effort. Your motivation to do all these high-energy-requirement tasks decrease massively if you have a quick fix available at home.

Think of porn as a perfect sex robot sitting at home. It will do anything you want. Real partners won't agree to do anything you want. Real people have jobs, lives, problems, insecurities, sometimes even past trauma which stops them from being vulnerable. Trust needs to be established. This takes time.

Even if someone is interested in you, it may take a long time to finally have sex (not that it should be the goal). It makes no sense for your porn-addicted brain to put in all this effort for something that can be simulated with the click of a button.

In some cases (not all) socially anxiety manifests because your brain is asking you 'What the fuck can these people give you that being at home can't?'. And when you're home, you start feeling guilty for not being out there, doubting your ability to socialize, wondering what happiness is -apart from the few moments of ecstasy when you climax to porn. So you go in for one more session and end up in the same place, only more inside the void, or depression.

Disclaimer; I'm not a scientist or therapist. These are things I've come to realize after reading the book 'Your brain on Porn' by Gary Wilson, and from personal experience.

Also, this addiction is difficult to study because porn can’t be injected into test animal subjects like other causes of addiction. However, monkeys were found foregoing juice boxes to see other monkey butts. ""

&#x200B;

**Erotica novels**

I read my porn rather than watch. If you're like me, let me tell you eroticas are a scam too! (not as bad as porn though)

Eroticas make you think the moment you touch your partners lips you'll get fireworks in your mind and there will be sunrise in your vagina. And when you don't feel that you'll be disappointed af (sigh i wanted to feel sunrise in my vagene)

Everytime someone comes in the novel there is ""bliss ecstasy firework sensation beyond belief amazeballs etc"" and that's not true either. Orgasms are awesome no doubt, but I've never had an orgasm that ""rocked me to my core"" or some other bullshit adjective (and believe me I've had some good sex) 

Eroticas make you think sex will be AMAZING and you'll feel AMAZING when your partner even looks at you and you'll AMAZINGLY come in 0.6seconds and have multiple AMAZING orgasms and his long shaft fills you up and there is nothing that has ever felt this good before 

And when you **don't** feel the above things, you think you aren't good enough at skinship, or something is wrong with your body, or your partner isn't adequate, (or your boobs don't work) or you'll never have good sex.

**That's just not true.** 

Sex is good. Skinship is fun. But it won't ALWAYS blow your minds which is **NORMAL**

tldr PORN AND EROTICA are NOT like real life sex

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chapter 5 - okay now you know that your ready, you've got your person, you got the consent, you know its going to be awkward af and your preconceived notions from porn or erotica novels is false

lets come to **SEX**

(this will be from girls POV cause I'm a girl but guys you need to know all of this too)

Let me tell you how amazing vaginas are. They self clean. They self lubricate. They stretch to take in pepes. They stretch to deliver out babies. They are versatile.. all you need to do is give the vagene some **FOREPLAY** and **time.**

Vaginas are **NOT holes**. You can't shove something up there because that won't stimulate anything, on the contrary it'll *HURT*.

**Vaginas need to get** ***WET***. What do you mean by get wet? -> When a woman is turned on (for women getting turned on is VERY VERY mental) her vagina starts relaxing and secreting lubrication. = getting wet 

The women will feel the wetness herself, or one can simply put a finger down there and you'll feel the ""liquid""

That means the vagina is ready for the peepee and you can have sex.

**Lubrication is the MOSTESTESTEST important thing to have pleasurable sex. You need to be mentally and VAGINALLY turned on.**

Otherwise it may hurt. 

How do women get wet? Foreplay!! -> Lots of kissing. Boobs. Butt. 1st base. 2nd base (best base!!!).  All bases. and once she's wet oh boy you guys will have a good time. 

If it's your first time it can take you *some time* to get wet. (for some people even if its their millionth time, getting wet takes some time and thats okay). **GIVE yourself that time**. Give your vagina that time. She needs to get stretchy and lubricated otherwise she won't have fun at all. And nor will you. 

Some women do **not** get wet even after foreplay. ""Dry vaginas"" exist and an easy solution for that is use lots of lube! (Can use even for ""wet"" vagina. It makes sex much more easier and pleasurable for both parties. Go lube!!)

Before penetration, its best if your partner puts up a finger-->two-->three up your vagina and you do some second base so **it primes your vagina for dat pepe**

First time of penetration will be the absolutely WEIRDEST FEELING *EVER.* 

(I didn't even know there were body parts there before it got touched by a pepe)and you need to **go SLOW**. Your vagina has to adjust and wrap around the bulky new object. Let her take her luscious time to adjust to the pepe.

Usually if you've done your foreplay correct, a few slow strokes are enough to get the vajayjay accustomed and then you can go any speed any depth enjoy

**Again first times will be awkward, if you are able to do all the above steps then thats it you're winner**

Usually the person will be able to hit your G spot (believe me you'll KNOW when he does) and if he doesn't **thats okay**. First times are hard and **you'll get there eventually**. You can always try orgasming via clit stimulation (going to call in C spot)

&#x200B;

Remember while all this is happening you **HAVE to TALK. ->** Tell your partner what feels good. What's turning you on. Where your  C spot is (Eg: Go a little left. No no that's too left. Wait I'll show you)

Tell them you like it when they do\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Ask them what they like

&#x200B;

My first time was crap and I didn't even feel 1% of pleasure. I hated sex and thought wtf is this what everyone is raving about. I never saw that guy again.

After that bad experience I was careful and the next time I had sex with a person I really liked and it totally changed my whole perspective of sex

We did lots of foreplay. He told me to tell him what feels good. He took time to find my C spot. He discovered my G spot (which I didn't even know existed)

And guess what. I saw him again and *again*. We met every weekend. 

&#x200B;

Guys. If you want to have sex again and again pro tip give the girl respect and pleasure and **she'll come to you.** (and vice versa)

If you can't orgasm in one way, try another way. There are lots of people who don't come with penetrative sex but they do with C spot stimulation.

**It's normal.**

it's okay 

Just communicate! 

A good partner will try their best to give you pleasure and **vice versa**.

Additional point : Vaginismusis an **INVOLUNTARY** contraction of your pelvic muscles (simple terms = vagina clenching) which obstructs penetration and can be painful! If you are experiencing Vaginismus means you or your vagina are NOT ready for penetrative sex. **You can continue other forms of sexual activity**, but penetration WILL hurt so delay it until your Vaginismus is over. Usually happens because of nerves/anxiety/not turned on enough. 
Let me repeat that it's INVOLUNTARY and you **cannot blame someone for Vaginismus**

&#x200B;

**How do you give pleasure to your partner?**

Kiss everywhere. Ask them what they like. Ask them HOW they like it. **Tell them to instruct you** (its not weird dw.. it can even be a turn on) 

No question is a stupid question. Ask them how they like their kisses. Use some teeth. 

I had no idea what to do with a pepe. Hell they still make me nervous and I can't look a pepe in the eye. 

I get nervous everytime so my go to is just tell the guy to **talk me through it/hold my hand** and guide me through what they like.

&#x200B;

Sex is between two people. Both need to enjoy themselves but more importantly **enjoy their partners body.** Communication is key

&#x200B;

Chapter 6 - **Self care** 

Again this is from a girl's POV because I'm a girl 

**Pre sex**

Getting naked is scary. It's a big deal. You are showing someone your body. Some parts that even YOU haven't seen. Some angles you'll *never* be able to see.

You're always your strictest judge. (And if you meet someone who's even more strict than you = by that I mean makes you feel bad about your body **DUMP them**)

You'll *never* look ""perfect""  

You'll have some bumps or pimples or body hair (everyone has boob hair you are not alone) or discolouration (EVERYONE'S VAGINA IS DARKER THAN THE REST OF THE BODY) or etc

and that's ***normal.***

You'll be insecure about the above and that's normal too.

**So do what makes you feel better.**

I personally don't like body hair. So if I'm going to be nakey nakey, I wax/shave body parts. I do a body scrub and then put on some scented lotion

I pamper myself and feel sexy af 

All this usually makes me feel great, less insecure, and gets me comfortable about the fact that I may get naked in the near future (not saying body hair isn't hot. but this is what works for me) 

Do whatever makes you feel better about yourself. There's no shame in taking care of your body.

**BUT if you see some imperfections, don't let it get to you.**

Let me tell you, most people are too **preoccupied with you** and your body to notice that pimple on your back

Also if you have some preferences, send a **gentle** and KIND message to your partner

For example I can't stand dirty long nails. I just can't and I shave down there so I expect the other person to do the same 

I usually send a gentle text message before the meeting that please do these two things to increase pleasure during nakey times

Most people are accommodating. I **can't obviously force** someone to do anything but if they do, it's a green flag and makes me like them more

&#x200B;

**During sex**

***CONDOM CONDOM CONDOM***

Guys wear a condom. For yourself and for your partner.

STDs = sexually transmitted diseases are **REAL.**

Not only HIV-AIDS but MANY STDs (Eg Herpes) are **INCURABLE**. You'll have it *for life.*

If you have **multiple** sexual partners you **ESPECIALLY** need to use a condom.

Not only that but you really really **don't** want to get surprise pregnancy

**So even if it's your first time, and no STD scare = USE A CONDOM**

Government hospital OBGYN department  give free condoms (on paper atleast, haven't ever tried that)

Also lying to your partner that you have a condom on /secretly taking it off later is a CRIME.

**Girls if your partner doesn't use a condom when you want them to, then you don't need to have sex with them . Say buhbye to that relationship**

&#x200B;

**Post sex**

Pee after having sex. It's supposed to prevent UTIs 

You'll be **SORE** after sex (guy friends have told me pepes get sore to) and **that's normal**

Your vajayjay isnt used to something being inside it and naturally it's going to get sore

if it's too sore and if any bleeding persists, please visit the OBGYN

Female STDs are **not as ""obvious""** as male STDs. that's why it takes longer to diagnose and longer to treat. Be vigilant about your vagina and its **secretions** and ofcourse **be vigilant about contraception and periods**.

Both partners have to be careful about contraception but the **burden of pregnancy lies on the female** so we have to be extra careful.

Get a period app to track your periods. If you're late you'll know and won't get any unwanted surprises (only helpful if you have regular cycle)

**Vagina/Intimate washes are a SCAM**. Your vagina cleans itself and balances it's own damn pH

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chapter 7 - **Too much sex?**

""You regret all the chances you don't take"" you've probably heard of this quote right? well this **DOESN'T FUCKING apply to having sex.**

I mean it.

I've had **more regretful** sexual encounters than happy ones. 

**Promiscuity is NOT equal to happiness** (applies to both genders)

The most happy I've been is when I was in a relationship with a person eventually leading to sex 

If you have sex for **the wrong reasons** like feeling lonely or for validation - it *drains* you emotionally.

I've has tinder dates that ended in eventually nakey times but other than the temporary satisfaction of some company and being ""validated"" it always **left me feeling empty inside**.

Sex for enjoyment is fun. It's nice but if it  becomes a coping mechanism or an act just for the sake of it, **then it's unhealthy**.

**If sex makes you feel guilty > than enjoyment = then something is wrong and you need to look at yourself** 

Sex is like everything else, too much of it, or misuse will make you feel like crap 

Remember in this case **No fun > regrets that can scar you**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chapter 8 - **Safety**

Girls and guys you NEED to be SAFE.

**Its 2847393% better to be safe than have sex**

Even if we are the second most populated country in the world, sex is still a taboo subject in our country.

Bollywood shows item songs with naked ladies but sex oh no no censor board where are you

Moral policing is real

You need to be safe from a partner AND safe from public/society as well 

&#x200B;

**Safety from society/public**

Suppose you have a partner who you can 100% trust (personal experience I can tell you sex with someone you like/love >>>>>> one night stand) , you **both** still need to be careful and safe from public/ society.

I'm a girl, I know what ""society"" thinks of sexually active girls. 

I believe in feminism and equal rights but I sadly am not courageous enough to tell my parents that I'm sexually active.

if you are your partner meet up in hotel rooms. be careful! Choose a **well established/good place** and split the charges rather than go to a seedy scary place just to save 300Rs

Your safety and privacy is more important than that (hidden cameras ftw)

**Ask your trustworthy friends or even college seniors for safe places they have visited for couples**

If you have your own apartment/place that's the best just **be careful going in and out** because curious aunty/uncles/security guards exist

If you are buying condoms or birth control go to a pharmacy far away from your place and preferably let the guy purchase it

Whenever you take/share nakey pictures remember it is A **LIABILITY**. **That person has a picture of you and you NEVER know what they will do with it**

(I am personally toooooooooo  paranoid. I never send pictures or even take selfies) 

&#x200B;

Skinship in public places is not illegal BUT moral policing is a thing and a **fucking scary one.**

If someone is moral policing you and you think it will escalate, **please leave.** Your safety is much more important. Remember you can NOT change someone's mind with one encounter when they've spent years in that kind of mindset/ideology.

There are more chances of you being hurt rather than changing someone's mind.

Also this uncle who's telling you to not walk around holding hands will be the first one to touch you inappropriately during violence so FUCK IT AND LEAVE.

**You are more important than one fucking awful persons ideology.**

&#x200B;

**Safety with your partner**

If you are planning to meet a new person, text, call ,send pictures, stalk social media first.

 Talk, ask questions, **send snapchats = its fun and it verifies no catfish** (catfishing = fake profile)

If there are **ANY red flags, then don't meet them**. Done. Finish. Nada. **You do NOT owe anyone a meeting if you aren't comfortable with them**. Tell them its not working out and end the conversation.  I'm not a fan of ghosting but sometimes its okay if the guy/girl won't stop bothering you 

**Get to know them** a bit **before** deciding to meet them. If you think they are 100% normal ONLY THEN meet them (better to be safe than have sex)

**First meeting ALWAYS always in a public place.** 

Having food is the safest cause you are in a public place for a long time where a waiter may remember you and cameras catch your presence

Also you'll get to sit talk and get to know each other which imo is the best part about meeting someone new!

&#x200B;

What I usually do in a second meeting is a movie. If you are feeling ""that type of way"" you can make out in a movie theatre and see if there is chemistry

I prefer meeting in public few times before moving to sexual encounters

But sometimes I just know that this person is safe, and I make exceptions in those cases (mind you I have a good filter)

Where you want to meet someone (your place/their place/hotel) is upto you.

I avoid hotels in one night stands. Don't prefer it. I live in a hostel so no option in coming back to my place. 

Usually we go back to the guys place, and when that happens **I send my friend his address/name/number/social media before hand.**

**ALWAYS TELL YOUR FRIENDS WHERE YOU ARE GOING.** (even if you are a guy. Scams are popular these days)

**Even if you are embarrassed. Your safety is more important than your pride.**

**IMPORTANT - Avoid getting drunk around people you don't know.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chapter 9 - **Contraception**

The worst thing that can come out of skinship is unwanted sexual touch

and the second worst is unwanted pregnancy

Remember **its much better to wear a condom than have to get an ABORTION** ( One method of abortion is Dilatation and Curettage where they dilate the cervix and scoop out the contents of the uterus) 

**YOU DO NOT WANT TO GET PREGNANT**

The consequences are *too* high

1)Talking to parents about it. Telling them you've had sex and then telling them you got pregnant from it. Double fucking nightmare

2) Society. No matter how ""modern and cool"" you are and how much you ""don't care about what they think of you"" thats bollocks and it HURTS when someone treats you like crap. And it won't be just you, they'll point fingers at your whole family. I'm not saying it's fair. But it'll happen and it'll suck

3) Abortion - if you get an abortion let me tell you. **It's not a easy thing**. Your body and mind WILL suffer some from it. It's better to avoid it (pregnancy) all together

4) If you decide to keep it. No problem. But **your whole life is going to change** because a baby is a big deal. And you will have to take care of it and love it 3000 because it's a cute innocent baby and it deserves all the love in the world

**MY POINT IS JUST DON'T GET PREGNANT**

BE SAFE!!

Condoms

Birth control pills

IUD

Injectibles 

There are lots of options

For me condoms alone have been enough and if ever ever i feel like there is a risk or doubt I take the morning after pill (i-pill)

CAUTION : The morning after pill IS EMERGENCY contraception ONLY. **It can NOT be used often** as it WILL mess up your health.

If you think you need pills more often start a regular birth control regimen

&#x200B;

**Please visit OBGYNs**. They are your friends. Most of the ones I've visited have been immensely kind and non judgemental.

Choose one doctor that you like and visit them.

Get a pap smear if you are sexually active as Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women in India

I **HIGHLY recommend getting HPV vaccine** to ALL women AND MEN TOO! Men should also get the HPV vaccine. People should get it hopefully before they start having sex. ->A person can get it after they’re 9 years old and up to 45 years old.
(I got one as a teenager before I knew anything about it because of my parents)

**It prevents HPV infections which is very very common STD for men and women and leading cause of cervical cancer**

Please talk to your OBGYN about the same

&#x200B;

Your last option if all  contraception fails, and you have decided you don't want a baby, is abortion.

In India abortion is **LEGAL** so **please do not go to any shady doctor**. 

I have not gotten an abortion or know anyone who has but I have read up on the rules of the **MTP Act** and this is what it says (I recommend you read it yourself because I'm paraphrasing)

Abortion is LEGAL in government facilities and government certified doctors when it is due to contraception failure/rape/will cause harm to mom and baby etc reasons (these have been mentioned in the act) 

A woman **does NOT** need her husband's consent to undergo abortion. Her consent alone is enough.

(btw only married women can get abortions ?? have to confirm this part) 

A woman has to be 18+ to get an abortion alone 

Abortion is only possible **upto 20weeks of pregnancy** (track your periods girls)

If someone is a lawyer they can probably give a better overview of the MTP act in the comments please

&#x200B;

Chapter 10 -  **Guilt associated with sex**

We live in a country of arranged marriages, ""what will people say"" and ""privacy means you are doing something wrong"" 

Having skinship can be associated with lots of guilt, especially if you are raised in a conservative family.

I've dealt with a lot of guilt, self shame, and feeling awful for wanting to be in a relationship or wanting to be sexually active.

and I'm sure I'm not the only one (sometimes I think i wish i was married so i could have legal sex lol)

I don't know the solution of this, its still something I searching for

I know I cant change my parents mind and their outlook

and I know that loving someone or sleepingg with someone is not wrong and does not make me a ""slut/whore/easy/no sanskaar""

&#x200B;

This battle

to please my family vs pleasing myself 

am I selfish? vs no I'm just living a normal healthy life 

etc

goes on my head often 

I still haven't found the answer and if you do, let me know 

&#x200B;

THE END.

&#x200B;

I'm open for any doubts and questions you have => pls DM (please don't send chat as reddit chat is awful and I won't be opening any of them)

I have exams coming up and this was my procrastination, now I'll go back to studies so please wait few weeks for DM replies

&#x200B;

Stay safe thats all I wish for 

(and happy too)

SEX ED EDIT :

1) Added ""Men should also get the HPV vaccine. And people should get it hopefully before they start having sex. A person can get it after they’re 9 years old and up to 45 years old"" in Self care section. Thanks kind redditor for pointing it out

2) Added very useful information about Porn addiction from kind redditor in Porn section

3) Added info on Vaginismus and Dry vagenes in Chapter ""Sex"" thanks u/spicyyedgelord 


4) Question, does PP size matter?
My opinion on this -

I'll answer with a girl's POV but you need answers from guys as well for this. 
This is just my personal anecdote and I could be wrong in this situation!
 

PP size **DOES and DOESN'T** matter.
Like different sized pepes, vaginas are also of different depths.


So rather than the size of PP it's actually the //PROPORTION// of your PP to her VV.
PP can be too small to stimulate a G spot. They can be too big that the whole length of it just won't enter the vagene and it'll be painful for the girl. Or it'll be a good proportion and both of you are happy.


Most PPs lie in good proportion range and only if a pepe is below or above standard deviation (of your population. Pls don't compare to African PPs) that it **may** be a problem
This is what I mean by ""Size matters""


But size doesn't matter too because if you are skilled, know how to use your body and your PP well, you'll hit every spot your partner wants. As I said before sex is an acquired skill. Learn with your partner. Don't rush it, and practice :p


Also there are many MANY many other ways to enjoy sex and orgasms other than penetrative sex. So in case you are lacking in any department, you can always make up for in other ways.


If someone is being mean to you about your PP or VV tell **them they are being an asshole**. Don't let anyone walk over you just because they are having sex with you, it WILL lead to insecurities and trauma that may last a long time. **It's not worth it at all**

Better answer for same question by u/UserSM 
Backing this up with an analogy: While batting, the size of the bat doesn't matter if you know how to bat. But if you don't, then even the best/biggest bat can't help you.

And good batting on bed means stimulating her, touching her right, turning her on and MOST importantly, being gentle the whole time. Not a single girl I know prefers the guy going to town on her like a furious robot like portrayed in porn. Some of us think that touching a girl means rubbing her down there like a caveman trying to light a fire. That's no fun for anyone involved. On the contrary, being gentle will turn both of you on on multiple levels.

So chill on the size and don't get obsessed with ""technique"". Instead, concentrate on building a good bond.. trust me, once that's done, your size will suddenly be the perfect size and the you will discover your own technique.

Protip: For girls with not so deep Vagenes, it gets really painful when the PP hits her cervix. Imagine getting whacked on your balls. To avoid that, if she's in pain, don't ram in balls deep all the way. Do the deed with only half of your length.

5) Additional super important points by u/UserSM 

**Backing up Chapter 8**;

Never never **NEVER EVER** allow anyone to take naked pics or videos or take them yourselves no matter how much you love or trust your partner. You can absolutely be the next MMS porn sensation on some shady porn website.

Let me spell out a situation for you;

Imagine you absolutely love and trust your guy and he is genuinely a nice guy who would never misuse your pics. So he records your love act on his phone, keeps it safe and all is good. Until his phone gets stolen. Then you are in **deep** deep shit. Be rest assured that your sexy performance is getting sold for money. **Homemade porn is a big market in India**. Forget his phone getting stolen, even if he cracks his phone screen and the repair guy gets a hold of your videos, it's game over for you. These are just two of the **many** possible ways your nudes can get leaked even if your partner didn't intend it to.

**So absolutely no nudes. And if your partner forces you for it, then better break up.**

​

**Backing up Chapter 9**;

MTP => Medical termination of pregnancy

It involves 3 steps.

a) Visiting a doctor who will prescribe you a few tests and an ultrasound.

b) Getting the tests and ultrasound done.

c) The doctor will check the test and ultrasound results to determine if it is safe to perform MTP. If safe then they will give you an oral pill and then insert another pill in your vagina. After this, your body will abort the fetus in a couple of hours. It will be like getting your periods but with x10 times the flow and cramps.

It is **important that you visit a qualified Gynac for this**. Like OP said, most of them are helpful and non-judgemental. If you feel that they're trying to fleece you, **go for another one**. Ask the MTP price on your first visit. **Steps (a) and (b) are really important** and should not be skipped because if it is not safe for MTP, it can lead to death. That's why you should avoid over the counter MTP kits even if it is much cheaper. Apart from being risky, it's also illegal. Visit a friendly Gynac. The one we visited was super helpful even though **we were not married** and gave us tips on how to avoid future unwanted pregnancies.

A few more points to take care of;

1)Always **check condoms for holes** They sometimes have tiny holes on them, especially the cheaper ones. I have found holes and had them tear mid sex with very well known cheaper brands. Durex is the safest available and a bit expensive but totally worth it.

2)Use period tracking apps only and only **if her periods are regular**. And for unprotected sex, leave a safety buffer of 5 days before and after the fertile window the app calculates. I can't stress enough how important it is to maintain the 5 day buffer.

3)Periods can be delayed for 5 days sometimes. **Any delay beyond that and you need to get yourself a pregnancy test.**

4)Always check your condoms after sex. **Never assume** that your condom didn't fail. To be sure, blow it up like a balloon or fill it up with water to find leaks if any.",Sex Education 101 for Indians,Non-Political," Well written. Hope you'd share it in other places for others too. The Education system could take a few tips from you but then they're so shy. Awesome write up! People posting pen pics can't relate. Well written post. Hopefully people will actually read it and understand meaning of intimate relation. India lacks sexEd in schools for most part. I would suggest ‘sex for dummies’. It’s a good start for teenagers/adolescents and even adults. Plus small comic strips make it fun and easy to read. Congrats OP! You've single-handedly managed to convey what no other educational institute or any form of ""cultural upbringing"" in this country has ever bothered to do even though the populace is popping out babies every few seconds. The average sex IQ of the country has indeed risen today, thanks to your post. extremely well written , I just hope that when my daughter grows up to that age [ there is still a decade or more , i hope] , that me or my wife can have this talk with her, or i can just save this post show her ten years from now. Never read such geniune post about sex education in my entire life. Everyone should read this. Very well written. 

Would like to add vaginismus:
When I first had sex he couldn't get it in. It was first for us both but I was kind of nervous and not wet (because of my nervousness). We wasted 3 condoms that way and then just gave up.

I was nervous because I wasn't on any birth control other than condoms. We tried the female condoms next and it hurt him a lot because of the lack of lube. 

Now I have bc pills and also been on the iud (didn't work for me) now I get sufficiently wet and my pelvic muscles don't tense up.

Vaginismus is very common during your first intercourse so don't get frustrated. Try to orgasm once before so that you loosen up a bit.

Anyone over 18 can get an abortion so I would recommend waiting until you turn 18 to reduce the stress from pregnancy scares and as mentioned try not to get pregnant. Absolutely avoid it. Me Nodding my head and carefully reading this post from end to end even though I know I'm not gonna get to have sex and probably will be single for my while life

hc08s8,,"Comparison Between 1 shot vs 240 exposures stacked together to demonstrate that you don't always need expensive equipment or a long drive to a darker area in order to capture the Milky Way Galaxy. Took this from Bhopal [Nikon D3100, 4608x6144][OC]",Photography," #Details:
First, please note that this image is a composite, meaning I first focused my camera on only capturing the Milky Way exposures, and then, I took one shot of the buildings(and myself) in the foreground and blended them together. The entirety of this image was taken from my terrace. 

My main aim is to show that you don't necessarily need professional gear costing lakhs of Rupees or to drive hundreds of kilometers to a darker area(especially in current times) in order to photograph the Milky Way. It can be done right from your own roof with just a simple DSLR and a laptop(and admittedly, time. LOTS of time)

#Equipment-

Nikon D3100, Nikkor 18-55mm kit lens, a cheap tripod, one remote shutter(you may be able to use your phone as a remote as well if your camera has Wifi)

#EXIF: 
F/3.5, ISO 3200, 15sx240 exposures


#Process:
1) First you need to locate the Milky Way. The best way is to download any star chart app, and find the constellation Sagittarius. I used [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.escapistgames.starchart&hl=en_IN) but you can use your own favorite.

2)Point your camera roughly on Sagittarius. As long as Sagittarius is in your frame, Milky Way will be as well.

3)Use the widest available lens you have. I took my shots with just a kit lens that came with the camera at 18mm. This is to get as much of the galaxy in our frame and also to avoid star trails(I'll talk about that in a minute)

4)You're going to need a remote shutter to take the images without touching the camera, because whenever you touch it, it will impart some vibrations to the camera and your exposures will have some blurriness. You can buy a cheap wired remote, or if your camera is fairly new it may have wifi capabilities so you can take exposures by using your smartphone. 

5) How to select your exposure length: If you set your camera's shutter duration for let's say 30s or higher, what you will see are [star trails](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/ua/PegasusTrails.jpg) where instead of pin pointed stars, you'd see them moving in a line, ruining our shot. In order to get sharp looking stars, use the [rule of 500](https://petapixel.com/2015/01/06/avoid-star-trails-following-500-rule/) which is essentially to divide 500 by your focal length(times the crop factor) and set the shutter time as that. Take a shot, zoom in and check the stars, if you see some trailing, lower your shutter length and test again. For my case, Rule of 500 gave me 500/(18x1.5)=~18s, but it was still a bit traily so I shot my exposures at 15s.

6) Take as many exposures as you can. If you're already in a darker area, 50-60 exposures will be good enough. I only took 240 because I wanted to expose the galaxy for 1 full hour. DO NOT change any settings in between the exposures. It's a good idea to not disturb the camera at all while it's taking the shots.

7) Take a few bias, dark and flat frames. [How to take these here](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/faq.htm#lightdarkflatoffset)

8) After all this, you can use any stacking software to process these shots. My favorite is Deep Sky Stacker and Sequator. Pixinsight is also a capable one, but it's not free so pick whichever one you like. 
The main job of stacking software is to align all the exposures and then sort of take an average of the frames which decreases noise and increases the Signal to Noise ratio of our image, so the final shot results in extremely high details and very less noise.

9) I processed the result in Lightroom, then added the foreground in Photoshop


Please note that this is a very simple explanation, and some of the rules and technologies I wrote above might have mistakes, or may not work in your case. Please remember, experiment and experience will give you the best results. Also, if I indeed made some mistakes above, please correct me.

Ask me if you guys have any other questions :) Amazed that you dont' have light pollution in Bhopal. Can you give tips on what direction to shoot, and how did you stack these? I would love to shoot in Delhi - these days with the COVID Lockdown, the sky is more or less visible, and also the lights are dimmed so we have very little light pollution u/vpsj If you have good editing skills, fuck equipment you don't even need a camera. Oh man this is epic. I recently acquired a Canon 1300D and I live in Pune, in your opinion could I learn to capture the milky way? [removed] इतना तो साला आँख से भी नहीं दिखता है, मामुली कैमरा देख लिया। Is it possible to learn this power ? !! How can you photograph Milky Way if we're a part of it? FAKE! Nicely done! 

I always wanted to do this!

Have you heard of this app called PhotoPills, very good app to track sun moon and the Milky Way, its has AR mode which will give you a preview on where it will appear for a future date and time. Although it is a paid app but it’s worth it. (Tip - Every year price drops to half during the Black Friday sales)

n5dxga,"Tejasvi Surya went public with a scam involving bbmp and bed allocation.

But instead,  his true target was to scapegoat Muslims and turn away the blame from Bjps failing to Muslims.

https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-questions-raised-over-veracity-of-bbmp-quota-beds/article34485020.ece

>The group of BJP legislators trying to expose corruption in bed allocation in the south zone, also made communally-loaded statements against those from the minority community working at the war room.

>Tejasvi Surya, Bengaluru South MP, came armed with a list of 17 names, all from the minority community and sought to know their qualifications. Satish Reddy and Ravi Subramanya, MLAs, took objection that so many people from the same community had been appointed at the war room. Their comments were live-streamed on Mr. Surya’s social media handles.

>Sources in the civic body said there are over 120 staff working at the south zone war room of which 17 were from the minority community. Following the face-off with legislators, most of them were fired.

Video. Where Bjp MLAs ask why so many Muslims have been hired. They ask whether they are hiring for a Madrasa or hajj Bhavan.

>BJP MLAs Satish Reddy and Ravi Subramanya turned the ongoing COVID crisis in Bengaluru into communal hate-mongering on Tuesday, when they, along with Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya barged into a BBMP COVID War Room and asked officers present if BBMP (city municipal corporation) was a Hajj Bhavan or a Madrasa to recruit only Muslims.

>Two people, identified as Rohit and Netra were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly charging between ₹ 25,000 and ₹ 50,000 for a bed.

Note the only two arrested are Hindus.

For the 17 Muslim bbmp war room volunteers, there are no accusations against. No accusation of scam against them. Just bigots asking why 17 Muslim men out of 120 staff picked and questioned. The only accusation they throw is why so many Muslims were hired(17 out of 120   staff). And questioning their qualifications.

Here is a complete list of all 120 staff of bangalore south. Note that all 17 Muslim men from that list has been singled out

Edit: removed as it had personal info



Last year it was tablighi jamaat. This year again targeting Muslims. Muslims have been at the forefront of cremating Hindus when their relatives can't do it. Sanghis are no where to be found.


And filthy bigots are spreading this on all WhatsApp groups. Calling them terrorists. A bunch of vile bigots are defending it even on bangalore subreddit.

Utter filth. No where you find such filth in the world when the pandemic is going on.

This is the kind of hatred which the majority subscribe to. Tejasvi Surya got elected with a majority in a constituency which is highly educated and extremely rich.

Even after the Tablighi Jamaat fiasco and all that is happening now with BJPs failure, the majority will still scapegoat and believe whatever nonsense this communal bigot spews.

>This could be one of the many reasons why critically ill covid patients are not getting beds. Some war rooms, set up by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) in the different zones, appear to be controlled by politicians rather than professionals. With political interference, the deserving are bypassed and those with influence are given beds, whether they require them on not.

>An unauthorised person, apparently close to the legislator of the area, was found loitering in the zonal war room, influencing doctors to allot beds to asymptomatic patients. This came to light on Thursday when a team of senior officials led by Rajender Kumar Kataria, nodal officer of Bommanahalli zone made a surprise visit to the war room, which controls the allocation of beds in at least 30 private hospitals. The person, identified as Babu, was shown the doors immediately.

>Multiple sources confirmed that Babu was not employed by the BBMP even on a temporary basis. Some said that he had visited the war room often since the last three weeks.

>A day after he was asked to leave the war room, a group of over 100 men barged into the command centre in HSR Layout on Friday, protesting his removal. It is alleged that the protest took place on the directions of Sathish Reddy, MLA of Bommanahalli Assembly Constituency.

>The issue has also reached Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa’s office.“We visited private hospitals to review the condition of covid-19 patients referred by the Bommanahalli war room. Many of them were asymptomatic patients and did not require hospitalization. This has possibly deprived many critical patients of hospital treatment,” an official said.

>BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that he was aware of the issue and would seek a detailed report from the nodal officers.

Seems like the bigots themselves ran a cartel. Many critical patients were denied beds because of these filth. Then when they were exposed by bbmp and it reached yeddyurappa, the opposing camp tried to ""expose"" it and blamed Muslims.","Tejasvi Surya barged into the south bbmp war room, picked all 17 Muslim men from a list of 120 staff, asked officers why they were hired and got them fired.",Politics," This guys is one of the most divisive Hindus I've seen, he's so smart he starts interpreting Quran and Hindu phrases to tell us dumbholes what it means

This is open and shut a case of the latter, debatable of the first also. Surely there must be a lawyer in Karnataka who can end this?

This is simply fucking unacceptable. And people here in this subreddit, have hopelessly high expectations towards our country's youth.....

  


As if somehow, the youth are more civilized, broad-minded and liberal than their previous generations.

  


And this is why, romanticizing or bashing one particular age group, isn't wise.

  


Nor will educated candidates be better elected representatives necessarily.

  


If this smug, arrogant millenial is supposed to be the representative of our ""educated"" youth then, it's a realisation that warrants worry, pessimism and concern. This comes on same time when 24 people died due to lack of Oxygen in Karnataka. And 4 people died on Saturday because of shortage of oxygen

Tejaswi knew there was a scam going on. So to cover up all this, he quickly shifted the blame to minority. These people have to attend like 20k+ patients and write their contacts and all and be prepared to give Media bulletin by 5PM everyday. Then there are beds and other parts. The Facebook post by Sarfaraz just shows how he was thrown under the bus because of his name and the RW has their hate machine-Whatsapp forwards ready

This guy is the worst, I hate him so much. Constant communalism everywhere, Already got L by TN election where he gave rubbish speeches. Was jealous of Srinivas (IYC) so started giving lemon juice to vaccinated people outside centers. How on earth did people even elect him Not only that, one of these MLAs Sathish Reddy himself was reported as running a racket in the war room 3-4 days ago: https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/cover-story/khadi-is-earning-its-bed-butter/articleshow/82334078.cms

This seems to be their way to divert attention from their own mischief. Bengaluru Positivity is around 55%...Plus BBMP is under  BJP and there was scam/corruption going on to allocate Beds, so no wonder Local BJP MP and MLA felt the need to divert attention and Give some communal angle...

And Story doesn't end here, Now There is Viral WhatsApp message too,

>The WhatsApp message listed names of 16 Muslim employees of the BBMP, branding them as “terrorists killing thousands of Bengalurians.”

It so vile that BBMP's Sarfaraz Khan, the joint commissioner, had to write emotional facebook post to Counter this claims by Surya instead of focusing on job at hand...

>“I believe and have believed that God is one, whether you call him Allah, Eshwar or Jesus... My allegiance is always to my country, to my government and to the Constitution of this country. Really pained by some people’s ignorance or mischief. I hope law takes its course.” “I am completely pained because a communal angle is given to this issue... blaming me, who has no knowledge and no concern with that department,” Sarfaraz Khan wrote.  This is violation of fundamental right, article 14,16. Should sue him. On the scale of chutiya to tejasvi(bright), this guy is motherfucking chutiya Abki Baar, Antim Sanskaar! BJP is getting desperate to hide it's failure.

Your songs brought me out of a dark dark place and continue to be a source of joy and solace. My sorrow knows no end. Rojaa Jaaneman.. Tu hi mera mann.. Tum bina... 😔 Grew up listening his songs. Every Sunday, we watch his program on ETV, where he sings his old songs. May god bless his soul. I don't know when he started his singing career, but he was there for all time singing any song that was heard in at least the past 4 decades.

edit:  One of the best voices, and of course one of the best singers ever! I learn from the TV news that he debuted in 1966 with the movie ""Sri Sri Sri Maryaada Ramanna"". My day never ends without his songs .  His voice will be reverberating as long as mankind exists. Rip 1. SPB held Guinness World Record for highest number of songs by a singer,  With an average of 930 songs a year or **2.5 songs a day**, S.P.B has sung around 40,000
2. He dubbed for actors. Over the years, he turned an actor, producer, and a music composer.
3. He won **6 National** Awards - in 1979, 1981, 1983, 1988, 1995, and in 1996.
4. **32 State** Awards - 25 Telugu, 4 Tamil, 3 Kannada State Awards
5. He also won two civilian awards Padhma Shri in 2001, Padma Bhushan in 2011.
6. **Music director for 46 films** in four different languages which includes Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Hindi.
7. **Acted in 72 films** in three different languages, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada He defined music for my generation, my parent's generation AND my grandparents' generation. A humble jovial man (from first person accounts). This loss for south India cannot be filled at all. Ever. ""இந்த தேகம் மறைந்தாலும் இசையாய் மலர்வேன். ""

RIP sir. This is a devastating blow to the morale for us in the south. Absolutely gutted. What a legend he was. He will he badly missed. Fuck you 2020. motherfucking 2020 never stops, i was hearing all his songs for the last month and now this, RIP"
innd9u,,Sati updated.,Politics," As a mental health worker what guts me the most about this whole situation is just the inability and unwillingness to accept that he may have suffered from issues of his own. Like, the media has undone years of good work hardworking mental health workers did to remove some of the stigma from mental illness and thanks to them we're right back where we started. The media today is only meant to distract people from real issues. I stopped consuming TV News 3 years ago. Everyone should do the same. Found this on twitter 

‘An attractive young (and unmarried!) woman being sacrificed at the altar by a violent mob that is accusing her of witchcraft because of a tragedy that befell her lover. Encouraged by a charlatan snake-oil salesman who puts money over morals. And working at a behest of opportunist politicians who see this a chance to seize and consolidate power by allowing the mob its sadistic vindication. The wise elders look on but are helpless. Will better sense prevail? Will someone be brave enough to take on the mob?’

Also, I think rhea is not going to survive in india even if she's pronounced innocent. People are going to lynch her. Apparently the trope of a sexy wimmin seducing an innocent young man has got everyone hooked on. She's the devil and everyone wants her blood. She better leave this country like tanushree dutta had to. the media is targeting her like crazy
it's probably like the scenario in Jolly LLB2 in which the Police Officer had already been proven Guilty by Media

Neither I nor the Media knows the full details of this case but they still have the guts to declare someone a criminal
That is just Bogus as I see it

I don't watch these News channels now but unfortunately I scrolled past Republic Bharat one day and I was surprised to hear the statement of its anchor
He said:
""रिया को सफाई देने का मौका क्यू दिया जा रहा है।
मुजरिम को सफाई देने का मौका क्यू दिया जाए""

This statement really got me thinking that India Media already has one foot in its grave and is even making statements that directly go against Human Rights Someone should file a case against Arnab for all of the baseless and unproven allegations that he has hurled against various people throughout this __media trial.__ I wonder how he sleeps at nights? I mean he knows he's feeding the greedy pig which are the viewers to the sensational content they demand for. Everybody wants a real life soap opera and he's peddling that like drugs. But I wonder if he ever questions his own conscience knowing that he's literally decimating someone's career and life just to feed the TRP machine. But that would make him slightly human so not keeping my hopes up... Its really sad......even if she's pronounced innocent, the media and the people in india won't let her live until someone else is pronounced guilty, in which case they'll channel hate towards that person, and i can already predict they'll completely switch and start tweeting #justiceforrhea.
The fourth estate in this country has gone to the dogs. They only care about their views and their fucking trp. Thats a brilliant sketch of arnab!! This is a crazy comparison! Media prosecutions put unnecessary public pressure on the investigations and draw quick conclusions which could be false. 

Shouldn’t there be a gag order on the Investigators from revealing active cases?"

i9egm5,"We live in Delhi and are currently living on rent. Our landlord is a lady who brought us into their home as she considered my mother to be an elder sister to her. They lived upstairs, we lived in ground floor.

The rent was decided to be 14,000 INR per month. We happily paid each month on time. Then lockdown hit us and our source of income was lost to us. We couldn't make rent for April after which the landlord and us had a verbal agreement that we will pay around 10,000 per month due to this pandemic situation. 

They kept haggling us on a day to day basis for rent, even before date of payment. We did give them money regularly even by selling our things such as refrigerator and all. Rent was regularly made by us each month..

Then month of July came and we paid around 5,000 on 10th July and promised another 5,000 on 25th. They agreed but still kept haggling us everyday and soon, arguments and fights started to happen. They would come to our place and sit for hours, and would also call us at midnight. . On the 23rd, they shut down our water supply (under the pretext that the motor was faulty and they needed 800 rupees for repairs) and demanded us to vacate their premises. 

We said that we have nowhere to go, and paid them another 1,000 for repairs of the motor after borrowing from a good Samaritan.. However, they did not restore our water supply and started fighting us. 

Their maid would call us names, would assassinate our character, disrespect us and whatnot. Same for the landlady.. 

We stopped payments to them as they refused to reinstate our water supply and on the 12th of August, they brought a big man to our doorstep who demanded to know the date that we will give them the possession. My mother said that we are looking for a place but again, the landlady started fighting and so did her brother as well as their maid.. 

And yesterday they pasted a legal notice on our door that we had to pay them 70,000 in arrears for rent and 5,500 for the cost of the notice. If we stay in the premises after midnight of 12th of August (this notice itself was served at midnight of 13th August) , it would be deemed illegal trespassing and would attract a fine of 1,000 per day.

We have paid for rent with sweat and blood and now they are claiming that we never paid at all and we don't have water in our house. What sort of legal recourse do we have? We can't afford expensive lawyer fees.. Advise will be very appreciated..🙏

Update : Thank you very much for your kind responses people of r/India. You all will be glad to know that we have talked with our landlord this morning and after a lot of request have got some time to vacate the place. By 25th of August in all probability. 

We are looking for a cheap place, my sisters have helped me with some money and my son (who is a 12th class topper currently studying BA Hons in Hindu college. Yes, I'm a proud boastful mother 😊) has even been offered a very good job by one of the kind patrons on this site. This means a lot and I wish the best to you wonderful people. 

Some people are expressing skepticism because we do not have a bank account and that our post is fake. If you need proof, please DM me your email and I will send you pictures of the legal notice in question pasted on our door and the rent agreement as well as the picture of the empty space where our water motor used to be. About account,  We do have a subsidy account (for gas subsidy)  that is almost useless because my ex husband deals with us in cash. It used to be around  a comfortable 24,000-28,000 per month before lockdown when his business was still going forward.. (guzaara bhatta/child support as one would say). There is no need to make joke with people online with sob stories. This can be verified by a Delhi moderator, as one person said. 

One person had also said that crowdfunding posts like mine should be banned and that begging shouldn't be allowed.. This was not very kind but I would kindly request you to please read my original post again and tag the line where I've mentioned that I need monetary help from anyone.  I only asked for some advise on how to approach this and I have already refused money from a lot of kind people and will continue to do so, as there are needier people out there. Sookhi roti and bread was all my son ate yesterday but we choose not to seek crowdfunding. 

I would once again like to thank you so much for your kind words and support this means a lot to our family and your support is something I will remember my entire life. I am also glad that the landlord were kind enough to give us some time to leave without any legal action. I have updated this in my original post as well.

You got to verify with the moderators and I am sure many of us redditors can pool in as per our affordability and enable you to meet your requirements.

You can also counter sue your landlord on the issues of what you have said above saying how you were harassed , inability of your landlord to provide basic needs like water and check if they pay their taxes on the rents ( cause many of them don't want to pay taxes) if they don't then it would be quite difficult for them to get a strong case on you."

*Summary generated by [sansa](https://sansa.news/) I wonder at what point we'll protest well \*gestures to everything\* India puts institutions like police, army at a special pedestal. So any criticism will automatically be labelled bad Ha ha....there won't be any protest, because there is no political backing and lack of genuine interest to reform. I doubt if it is even possible. 

Politicians, Babus, police, media...have their own world. Ordinary people just want to live with minimum trouble. The protest is done if something happens suddenly, like some villager dies in a road accident, or something fucks up with religion.

Living with dignity is not something our people expect. Even if half the country gets together and protest, there will still be no meaningful change in the system. There is no way current government will allow any meaningful police and judiciary reforms. There is no war in Ba Sing Se! Protest? Some (extra judicial) police killings are celebrated in India. Like the ones in Hyd and UP. Meanwhile, Nigerian youngsters did an #EndSARS campaign, and that police team was removed. Now, they're calling for action on acts of brutality by them.

Big difference between us and them. Priorities of Indians are different.

Many would justify police killing, most don't give a damn about this. Rest, are not even aware of this issue. Thak gya hu bro There will never be change in this country. In 1997, former judge of Supreme Court and other members got together to probe police murders in Punjab, and named it ""Lok Commission"" and started their hearings from families in a Chandigarh Gurudwara. One famous statist journalist, Jatinder Pannu and a BJP leader, filed a writ petition in Punjab & haryana High Court that this commission will demoralize Police and defame it. Communists of Punjab did not rent out the famous ""Desh Bhagat Memorial Hall"" in Jalandhar to the commission on the pretext that these people are Khalistanis. The judge, G S Singhvi, dismantled the commission saying the name of the commission matches that of one act of Constitution, ""People's Commission Act"", hence the commission is banned. Lawyers couldn't fight back as they were starved of funds. The same fucking journalist represented India at UNHRC to say all is well in India, we are fine, don't look. He was sub-editor of a communist rag ""nawan zamana"", which was Republic of those times essentially. I think this ""Nawan Zamana"" was funded by KGB, as the son and daughter of its editor both were packed off to Soviet Union for their studies. Son came back and wrote a very critical book about communism and Soviet Union, he was there during its fall. Jatinder Pannu now sits in Canada says spews same bullshit like Shekhar Gupta. 

Police will always get away with killings in this country due to people who provide cover even if a section of society rises up.

Also, people should examine journalism of Shekhar Gupta and Tavleen Singh about Punjab insurgency. You will open your eyes, and see how consistent he has been throughout his writings - in defense of power under the name of ""national interest"". Famous lawyer who uncovered Police killings in Punjab, Jaswant Singh Khalra, was killed by SSP Ajit Singh Sandhu in 1995 after torturing him for 48 days. Sikhs in US mobilized and President Clinton assured their representative through a letter that US Ambassador, Frank Wisner, has raised the issue with Indians. India moved quickly after Clinton's letter and instituted a NHRC case against the murder. Ajit Singh Sandhu committed suicide after jumping in front of a train in 1997. Next day, KPS Gill held a conference pinning the blame on human right orgs. BJP guy Jaswant Singh, LK Advani, Congressi Captain Amarinder Singh all blamed Human Right orgs. Tavleen Singh's column in india Today said ""killers of Sandhu are human rights wallahs"".

Nothing will happen in this country since defenders of Police have all but multiplied and Police is goaded and lauded for their killings. Only good thing is that these incidents are now being recorded and tabulated."

I think having a 'Gandhi' will just put people off even if its the right candidate. For this reason I honestly think RG needs to step aside from congress, he should have stepped aside long time ago.

US did not choose Bernie or Warren, or the hipsters choice Pete, they found the most electable (although borderline senile) candidate and won the election. That's the need of the hour in India.

nhipjw,"Yeah I used to be this extremist right winger supporting BJP no matter what, forcing decisions of the government down the throat of people. Whether it was CAA, Farmers bill or any other shitty law this government passed. I always used to fall for the fucked up logics set up by godi media and thought that these people are antinationatls and shit. But now that I myself am facing such fuckery by this government, I am sorry to each and every person and their concerns i misunderstood. This government doesn't want to hear or answer it's people. Just shoving up the decisions up our asses as if they own this country. This a democracy, not a fucking dictatorship that you can do whatever the fuck you feel like.

You don't get to ignore our pleas and act as if everything's normal. Fuck you BJP, there's no way I'm gonna vote for these fuckers in the next elections. The mental stress they've put us through all these months, i hope these guys rot in hell.

Edit: To everyone hating on me for opposing the government only when I'm personally facing problems, yes I am sorry for not realising the fuckery of this government earlier. I would've never mentioned about CAA or Farm laws if I never cared. I would've simply ranted and that's it. Yes, I was blinded by the media and my own family into treating these people as Gods.  Nope, not anymore. I'm really sorry to each and every person who's problems and voices I overlooked. I'm really sorry for not realising and standing up against the wrong when it was needed the most. But we all learn with time and experiences, don't we? It took me a bit long, but I'm definetly past that. Thanks.",Used to be this kattar BJP supporter but you know what?

They had brainwashed me so much that everytime i questioned their theory or ideologies I'd get blasted and called shameful stuff. So i stopped questioning and let them wash my brain because otherwise i have no peace at my own home.
Last year, i got into so much questioning and curiosity of why are people fighting and protesting so much, why do i know only one perspective, what's their perspective? I started researching heavily.
And few months later, i hated bjp so much, i hate my dad so much that i stopped talking to him.
I am currently going for therapy for the hate i have for my dad and its not letting me survive in my house. He's very politically vocal and is extreme rightist.

My dad wasn't like this until these bjp fuckers put seed of ""hindu rashtra"" in his head.
I hate my religion because of the current political party.
I'm almost questioning everything.
Growing up my dad was my only hero, the one guy i was always lookin up to. Now i dont have that, it sucks. Feels like a demise. If i argue with him his bp shoots up and he collapses.

I need help :( Were you really an ""extremist right winger""? What was your opinion on Hindu rashtra then and now? Seems to me you're just pissed because this time the issue deals with you, while earlier you didn't bother to read up. >This a democracy, not a fucking dictatorship that you can do whatever the fuck you feel like

Idk man, reading your post destroyed my morning, it feels like you have no empathy at all, and only care because now things have come at your doorstep. I just hope you don't go back licking their feet next time they play a card, and actually grow to care for the people around you. Read the title, came here to troll, then read your post. 

I will show myself out. Here's what BJP has done to Hindus. Haath mein hindu musalmaan ka jhunjhuna de diya hai, aur gaand mein bamboo daal diya hai. Here are few reactions.
Most of the bhakts are just happy to see Muslims suffer. In their brain it's their bravery compensating for their ancestors' defeats and cowardice, and they're making up for lost Hindu glory. 
Some like you have understood for the first time that this government ain't gonna do shit for you. Like I'm not a Congress fan, because I know it's the lite version of BJP, but holy fuck if JL Nehru was like modi Or shah, we'd have been an exemplary failure. So what are your current views on CAA and NRC? If your change comes after careful consideration and you don’t go back to supporting them, well and good. If you are just venting out and will go back to them after you calm down, then you haven’t learnt anything. Hope it’s the former. If it is, then good.

1. The common man already is on shortage of money.
2. He/she is also dealing with medical and usual expenses.
3. Apart from this and tearing up from his/her savings, he/she should also donate to the fundraisers.
4. He/she should also ensure enough money is there for future survival and to stay afloat.
5. All of this is because of the ""halo effect"", because someone can hit a ball with a bat, and is an actor hence they are our heroes, hence the money will definitely reach the people in need. There is no confirmation on the proper use of the collected funds even though it ia technically possible. 
6. Why can't these celebs just donate and keep it private? The only decent way of doing this is by matching whatever funds are collected from the ordinary citizens. The Indian tendency of hero worship leads to unreal expectations. Then in situations like this their real face is revealed. Unlike Hollywood, bollywood will never take on the govt. bunch of sycophants who want to absolve themselves of tacitly supporting this nazi regime. Which they will use to buy themselves more influence. Anybody who still believes in Indian celebrities is a fool I read this comment somewhere on Reddit and I’m paraphrasing it here.

‘I have 99 chocolate bars, my friend has 1,

I take his bar and give it someone who needs it and then say “WE helped”!’

Anyway who knows, they (all celebs doing a fundraiser)might have made a personal donation separately and this fundraiser is separate. More like super-rich everywhere. Why just corner Indians like they are the only ones pulling this shit? Besides, if people want to donate to a cause, let them. Unpopular opinion: 
- they have the power to get attention 
- if you don't trust PM cares you have some place to donate 
- they have donated first  they are just asking others to join
- there are Indians unaffected (financially) or from a background that have sufficient that they can share but don't have a way to. 
- there are not forcing people to donate.

Why do we expect them to donate (they have) but when they ask others it's an issue? 

If they have not themselves donated and asking others then I would have understood the issues/concerns that this poses."

But ultimately, we all know whos gonna win. The pornhubers 💪🏽 Like Tiktok should have gone down long ago but its funny to me (and slightly infuriating) the reason for which it went down. They didn’t remove it to improve ratings of TikTok. They removed it because of vote bombing. Can someone tell me what is the point of rating bombing Tiktok 1 star? It's already a well known app so not like it's going to lose popularity even if it doesn't turn up in searches; and we all know Google is not going to remove that app since it's a huge platform and money maker for them. It's still at 1.4. anyways you can only remove from suspicious accounts like bots. Removing them from a genuine account is not possible even for Google. 1.5 is way too high for such a nuisance filled spyware. TikTok's rating on Google Play Store has increased from 1.2 stars to 1.5 stars with 22 million user reviews after Google removed over a million TikTok reviews overnight, according to a Twitter user. TikTok’s ratings fell last week after Faizal Siddiqui, a TikTok user who glorified acid attack on his TikTok profile, was banned from the platform and the videos were removed.

jis0sw,"I had posted previously about this topic but now there is more news. To begin with, a lot of Indians don't understand bullet calibers. To get it out of the way, bullets are not interchangeable. A bullet of 7.62 * 39 calibre cannot be fired from a rifle that shoots 7.62 * 51 and vice versa. I hope everyone understands that.



So here's the problem. The Indian military it seems will be using 3 calibers of bullets for their battle rifles. Which makes no sense at all. I can understand if the rifles have separate roles, but they will all be standard infantry rifles.


The Indian military in order to replace its ageing and useless indigenous rifles have chosen 4 rifles, seemingly without coordination. These rifles are-


1. Trichi Assault Rifle (TAR). Fires a 7.62 * 39 bullet. It's made indigenously by the Ordinance Factory Board. This seems to be nothing more than a copy of an AK-47 with minor improvements. Everything about it screams like an attempt by the OFB to stave off it's shuttering.

2. AK - 203. Fires a 7.62 * 39 bullet. This is a joint effort by Russia and India to be manufactured at Amethi. Making a new rifle is an expensive affair and this rifle is more expensive than actually just buying one from a private company. I have doubts on whether it will actually succeed. It's been delayed numerous times.


3. Sig 716. Fires a 7.62 * 51 or 7.62 NATO calibre bullet. This is made by American/German company Sig Sauer. It's a heavier calibre bullet. India ordered 180,000 + of this rifles and it has been distributed to soldiers already.


4. Caracal CAR 816. Fires a 5.56 * 45 or 5.56 NATO round. This rifle is very well made and is widely praised. A lot of Middle Eastern countries have adopted it. India ordered 80k+ of this rifle that will be delivered soon. But because of ""Make in India"" initiative,  any extra orders are scrapped. Caracal has offered to manufacture in india. It is yet to be seen what will happen.

The bullets and their differences.


1. 5.56 NATO. This is the standard infantry rifle bullet used by NATO. It's light and has a higher velocity and accuracy upto 500 yards. It's proven effective since the 60's. It's widely available and is already the standard calibre for indian military.

2. 7.62 NATO. This is a larger caliber bullet. It was the standard for Europe and even India prior to the INSAS. It's much heavier but has a longer range. It's accurate upto 1000 yards. The drawback is that because it's bigger, soldiers can carry fewer amounts of ammo. In the Falkland wars, British troops experienced ammo shortages in battle as a result. Thus they switched over to the 5.56 NATO round. Nowadays, it's used mostly as a sniper/marksman/machine gun bullet. Or for police.


3. 7.62 * 39. This is the bullet of the Soviets and Communist countries. It's been used since the 50's. It works similar to the 5.56 NATO interms of range. 500 yards. But it's heavier. So the same disadvantage of the 7.62NATO. Russia is switching over to a smaller caliber as a result. Which raises the question, why is india buying guns of this calibre? This is effectively an obsolete caliber. It's makes no sense.

India needs to modernize it's military. But there seems to be no sense or plan on how it plans to do that. The US and most of NATO and allies use the 5.56 NATO. It works. We already have stockpiles of 5.56 NATO ready. 


A team of soldiers in the field must have standard ammunition. It helps to make sure that soldiers can exchange bullets when they run out during battle. Some differences can exist, snipers and machine gunners need heavier calibers but the infantry rifleman should be armed with the same calibre of bullets. This doesn't seem to be happening. Different factions seems to be fighting within procurement department of the military. 


It's going to be a Bofors-like cluster fuck. No one is raising any objections or questions about this. Not the opposition. Not the media. No one.",The Indian military and para-military are doing something bizzare and unplanned,Politics," 7.62x51 - prior NATO Battle Rifle calibre (FN-FAL / G3 / AR 10 / Ishapore L1A1 which is an FN-FAL variant) usually semi-auto but with full auto variants for special use cases.

Case length : 51 mm

5.56x45 - current NATO Assault Rifle calibre (M16 and variants) full-auto

Case length : 39 mm

5.45x39 - WP Assault Rifle calibre ( AK 12/ AK 100 series and variants) full-auto45
Projectile dia : 5.45 mm
Case length : 39 mm

IA moved from the Ishapore L1A1 7.62 NATO to INSAS  5.56 NATO and now wants to switch again to 7.62x39 WP calibre. I really don't understand what what they're doing? 

They discarded the 7.62 NATO calibre for the 5.56 NATO calibre and now are switching some divisions to 7.62 WP and some divisions to 5.56 NATO. What is happening? Why create separate and complicated logistics chains with 2 different types of standard ammo? 

China has standardised on 5.8x42 for their entire military. Pakistan is still sticking to their 7.62 NATO G3's. While we have spent crores to move from 7.62 NATO to 5.56 NATO and now to a mix of NATO/WP calibres. 4 different calibres over a space of 2 decades! What waste and so much confusion in times of war. 

China decided the 5.45 and 5.56 weren't good enough for it and chose a near intermediate 5.8 calibre for itself. It had the discipline to make a choice and stick to it. The Army needs to make up it's mind. It's not the babus who decide on calibres, it's the Army, and they can't make up their minds. 

Sig Sauer or FN or Colt or Caracal or Kalishnikov have a choice of rifles in std NATO/WP calibres. The buyer makes the choice and they will supply it. If the end user (IA) cannot make up their minds, it on them not on the sellers or the babus. Contrary to popular belief, the standard Indian Army issue ammunition for INSAS is 5.56 INSAS ball ammunition which is different from 5.56 NATO(SS109). INSAS is compatible with SS109/M193 as well. A less well known fact is that 5.56 INSAS steel core 64 grain 5.56mm ammunition fired from INSAS has a projectile speed of 3050 ft/s and can penetrate Level-IV BPJs at 200 meters. This is one of the best performing, if not the best standard issue 5.56mm ammunition out there.

I wouldn’t comment on the quality of OFB’s INSAS manufacturing line and QA though.

No order for CAR 816 has been placed. As an Indian I am inclined to believe that this is just as much of a fuck up as any other government contract. 

Any chance you could post this in r/geopolitics, OP? People there generally have more of an insight into these matters. Thanks. [deleted] This is just the tip of the iceberg my friend you should see what's happening over at air force it's a logisticians nightmare and this is mostly because of both uniformed and civil Babu's who have a problem with everything. Even if a project gets cleared by MoD finance ministry starts making problems if not then then DRDO has the first right of refusal. I am pretty sure as far as the trichy is concerned we were about to get foreign made rifle but DRDO said that we will make the rifles on our own No one is raising these questions because of stupid nationalism present among people, you would be termed anti national if you speak against of Indian army. > To begin with, a lot of Indians don't under bullet calibers 

\*\****Laughs in Pubg mobile\*\**** First off, yes you are right in your main point that the Indian small arms bureaucracy is incompetent and has been making poor/corrupt decisions for decades. Firearms are not difficult to manufacture in this day and age, which is why so many small American firearms companies can start with one CnC machine and a handful of people and produce really great products used by the Navy SEALs and other top tier units.

&#x200B;

That said, the 7.62x39 is not obsolete. While the Middle East is slowly showing more usage of 5.56/5.45 rifles, 7.62x39 is still the standard and it's not just because of its wide availability. 7.62x39 is a great cartridge for urban warfare because it's a great balance of low recoil and high bullet weight. The high bullet weight is great for punching through brick, cement blocks, small trees and shrubs, cars, and other barriers. Of course, it weighs less than 7.62x51 NATO and doesn't have nearly the velocity so if you know you will be shooting people behind a wall then go for the full power, but it strikes a great balance. 

&#x200B;

Next, 7.62x39 is more reliable than NATO cartridges in extremely cold environments. This is because it has more taper, and thus there's less friction when extracting the round. There are downsides to taper of course, so everything is a trade-off, but that's a great feature when you are fighting high up in the mountains.

Furthermore, every army wants to be cool and give their soldiers short-barreled AR-15 rifles like the special forces have. The downside of that is that the 5.56 bullet depends on velocity to do damage to tissue via fragmentation. The M16 shot a very light 55gr bullet out of a 20"" barrel, maximizing fragmentation distance. Modern 5.56 bullets are heavier to penetrate more, and are being shot out of barrels of 10-14"" in length. This can reduce the fragmentation distance to under 100 yards. That's fine when you are busting down doors, but not so fine when you are fighting in mountains. 7.62x39 relies on its size and sometimes yawing to do damage, which means you can drop the barrel length down without as much as an impact on deadliness. Also, heavier bullets with smaller powder charges are more efficient in short barrels, which is why pistols have very heavy bullets relatively and very small powder charges. 7.62x39s barely lose any performance down to 10"" whereas the 5.56 is essentially useless under 10"".

&#x200B;

Finally, supporting multiple cartridges can be done, it just depends on the skill of your logistical system. The Russians in Syria use both 5.45 and 7.62x39 depending on the situation and it's not a problem for them. French anti-terror units use 5.56, 7.62x39, and 7.62x51 depending on the role. US troops often operate with a designated marksman in the squad with a 7.62x51 rifle. Fun fact: The INSAS rifle doesn't have a full-auto mode in order to save money. The imported AK47 that terrorists use does have it. This thread is so damn informative, it reminds me of a time when Reddit was used mostly to share knowledge like this Since the government has pivoted to **Atmanirbharism**, can I request you to kindly add one more contender to your esteemed list ?

Presenting the **Katta MKA-1** pistol capable of firing  .357, . 380 auto and 9mm bullets.

This splendid pistol is suitable for close combat and is named in honor of Nawab Mir Kasim Ali of Munger, Bihar.

We will regret not raising our voice sooner once it is too late. Such a long statement, without mentioning cow, pakistan or Rahul Gandhi. I am disappointed. If the BJP can promise that the detention camps are just for Muslims, everything will be OK, right? /s


I can't believe the apathy so called ""secular"" Hindus have towards Muslims. a bjp guys car in assam was found full of evm. EC says they just took a lift from the bjp candidate as their car had an oversight Everybody who’s not a bhakt or from the majority religion probably already knew what the camps could mean when news of them was out. Good that PV said it out loud though. This guy never speaks non-sense. How can it be? CPM is our only hope What does that white green mean? True, but isn't that how communism works too? Just fear mongering for votes. Politicians have mastered this art."
gvqkt5,,"Abhay Deol slams ‘woke Indian celebrities’ talking about black lives but not minorities, migrants in India - bollywood",Politics," In 2017, he talked about fairness cream ads and celebrities endorsing them too. Respect to the guy for speaking out. He is right. Why the hell are Bollywood stars posting about this which is happening in the USA? Just to gain some attention? They are saying black lives matter, but doesn't cast dark tone actor's, even krishna according to mahabharat is blue (or dark tone , may be black) but most time acted by fair guy.. Here's a harsh fact.

How many of us would post against any political party, religion or a controversial issue on a public platform like LinkedIn or Facebook? Most of us won't because of the fear of facing a harsh retribution. Even though I wish, I won't post or talk the same publicly as I do on an anonymous platform like reddit because of the fear of a backlash.

It's the same with Bollywood celebrities. I am sure most of them are liberal, aware individuals who can form their own independent opinions and care about many issues affecting India. Unfortunately, the fear of retribution from political & religious groups prevents many from voicing their true opinions. 

Even when Bollywood celebrities have raised controversial opinions that were against the opinions of majority, they have faced immediate retribution. Recently, Deepika Padukone showed her support for CAA demonstrators. We all know how she was targeted by political hacks and online trolls who even made attempts to boycott her movies. Amol Palekar showed support for Kanhaiya Kumar and he was trolled incessantly on social media. Swara Bhasker, Javed Akhtar & Anurag Kashyap are popular targets on social media only because they raise unpopular opinions. Ekta Kapoor had an FIR filed against her because a director showed an unsavory scene in her OTT film. Despite being big stars, Amir Khan was termed an anti-national when he made a statement of lack of free speech as was SRK when he had a Pakistani actress in his film. There are countless other examples of it. In a vicious, politically-charged, majoritarian environment where unethical practices can be used against you, no one wants to risk being a victim for making an unpopular opinion.

Even today, a controversial statement or a scene can get your film banned or boycotted in any state because a few don't approve of it. 

Putting forward your views is great if there is a truly an environment for free speech without undue harassment or political backlash. However, such an environment really doesn't exist in India as it does in the US. Not everyone wants to get his film stalled, lose money, destroy career prospects, get his family abused or go against the ruling party by making an unpopular opinion.

Online activism is great but not at the cost of rational behavior & personal damage.

Just as most of us won't raise controversial opinions publicly, Bollywood celebrities are correct for not doing so either.

It doesn't make them hypocrites because it reflects on the lack of true free speech in the country. Just because they don't voice their opinions on all national issues, it doesn't mean they don't have opinions or feel for issues affecting India.

Abhay is brave for voicing unpopular opinions and should be congratulated. But, not all celebrities are. And, they should not be derided for doing so because there are valid reasons for it.

And, those who still criticize Bollywood celebrities, just remember that not many of us don't make controversial opinions publicly either. I do not care what his views are on other things but he's spot on for this one. 

Celebs from the Indian film industry and also from other countries are always inconsiderate, hypocrites and extra woke. Half of the times they ignore shit going on in their own countries and prefer not to speak or else it'll result in their downfall if their fans don't like what they say. 

Indian film stars want to talk about ""Black Lives Matter"" movement but half of them have had [made advertisements promoting fairness creams](https://twitter.com/aluminiummaiden/status/1267060957324488704) and influence people into believing that fairer skin is better and now they want to talk about a movement which is anti-racist and against colourism. 

Speak up about how colourism prevails in Indian society, how darker skin is looked down upon, talk about how brutal Indian police can be towards poor people and minorities and then talk about America. You can't ignore and not talk about what happens in your own country and move on to speaking about another. They worship the whites. Some of them have a very weird inferiority complex. Remember when Ranbir Kapoor fell on De Niro's feet? There is so much irony at play here. He's probably the most self-aware guy in all of Bollywood. I wish more people come like he did. Indian celebs are not even showing a tiny part of the care and worry they are showing to George Floyd's death. I mean black lives matter, I know, but so many lives in India are suffering too. They're voices are not being heard. Anyone know what's up with Abhay Deol recently?

Of late, he hasn't been in any notable movies (for the past few years).

He was the hottest star in the late 2000s (Dev D, Oye Lucky).

What happened? There is no harm in supporting the BLM protests but being silent about the age old racism and other wrong done to minorities is the problem. You don't speak when something happens in your country, you say you have no political opinion on it but when it happens in the west to try to show yourself as an ally. Well that's hypocrisy."

jket3i,"This man has been harassing my sister from the past 8-9 months. He says he is a member of RSS. So the thing is, my sister got enrolled in a PhD course in DU, this man(himself a PhD from BHU) suggested my sister for the supervisor. So after the fees deposition, he started to harass my sister saying it was because of him she was enrolled(forgetting the fact that she is a JRF scholar and there was also an interview before supervisor selection). Blackmailing her that he has a lot of connections through RSS so he has the ability to harm the family and will get out clear, he took her stories/articles (my sister writes stories, many have been published in magazines too) and published them in his name. A few days back he started using this tactic to force her to marry him. She declined, so today this man came to my sister's room, I had advised my sister not to open the door if he comes. He came and requested my sister to open the door to just talk, but she didn't, after a while she opened to check if he's gone, he was sitting beside the room quietly and he barged in and locked in from the inside and started hitting her. She shouted and people nearby came so he opened the door and ran away taking some books and some of my sister's clothes with him.

I'm 18 and I don't know what can I do to help her. I'm about 500-600 Kms away from her location and my parents are in bengal. She's on her own right now. We both didn't tell our parents as my father is a heart patient and we don't want to worry them. I told her to call the women's helpline 1091. She also has the voice recording of the whole incident. She also has photos of hit marks on her face. I'm literally shaking right now. Just guide me please.

Edit1- The police have reached out to her after she dialled 1091. They took her to a hospital for observation

Edit2-(2:35 am) She has been discharged from the hospital and the police told her to come after 6am to file FIR.

Edit-3 She's afraid to go out alone to file the FIR, she has contacted DCW and they have assured help. I've also informed my parents.

Thank you all for the support and advice. We'll definitely fight this.

She will help your sister for sure. Dude...file an fir wherever you can. Tell your sister to change rooms with some friends. Involve police asap. Just mentioning. Tell her to backup all the evidences she got in cloud (Gdrive and One Drive), before she might get told to handover the phone to the police.
You can never trust the police when politics is involved. Dude, is your sister still staying where this guy knows where she is? Does she have local friends? People she can shift in and stay with? And please get a lawyer involved and restraining order against him. If she is in DU then law fac, runs a pro Bono unit - ask her to get in touch. Tweet about it. Tag RSS and police and all.
If police doesn't help immediately, bring her back to your home state for no, and think of further action. It a big matter, don't take it lightly. Let the police procedure move as it is. That part seems to be going well.

The rest of the advice is good too.

She has to change her room. Can't have him appearing suddenly and scaring her. Ideally move in with some friends for the time being.

And at the moment, safety is paramount. So restraining order or no, she should not be alone anywhere. Tell her to make sure she is with friends and that they know the story.

Install call recorder app in phone, test and make sure its working. If he calls to threaten or so, that will be additional proof. DM me if you need any help. ANY AT ALL. I live in Delhi. I hope your sister feels better soon and this guy gets the punishment that he deserves. 
Such asshole human beings exist in the world that it is unbelievable at times! Whatever happened to jio aur jeene do.
Nahi bc hum chutiye hai aur chutiyapa karenge I sincerely hope this post gets more attention. And you receive the help you require. Write an email to the NCW and try to see if there is a Mahila Thana (all women police station) in the area. Document as much as you can, messages or otherwise.

Edit: What the other redditors said about the not being alone part. Make sure she stays with a friend for now and along with National Commission for Women there are also other organizations that you can approach for help. Find a lawyer, National Law University and Delhi faculty of Law both have a pro_bono cell and they will definitely help. Good luck OP. Get ANY local news agency involved. Somehow as soon as they print it, the police seems to come into action pretty quick. I've personally witnessed this

Its really a good thing that at least the foreign media is doing something and in one way or the other is helping us citizens to bring down the facade of our leadership and governance which has now been going on for the last few years. I hope this continues. I hope at the end of all of this we stand strong as a community not divided further by any social construct but instead we work together to finally build a better future for ourselves. Have hope my fellow Indians. We can always do better and we will. Thanks for sharing, it’s heartbreaking but glad that CNN is covering it so well and world is watching. Fuck I’m in tears. Fuck you modi, hell has a special place reserved for you, you moronic cunt! fuck this government. Maut ka Saudagar indeed. And ch0des are meanwhile crying ""MuHHHh PosITIbE NEwZz"" Did you check BBC's take on it ?

lrvadp,,"Indians Work Longest, Earn Least With Virtually No Time for Leisure: ILO Report",Policy/Economy," Slaves for life 🧎🧎🧎 We pride ourselves in working overtime every day and seldom sleeping, but does it benefit us to live this way? If hard work was the winning formula then wage laborers would be our rulers and kings. We indians from childhood have been wired to equate success to two things
1) money
2) people's impression of us

The previous generations were largely not aware of the alternate scenario but thanks to mark Zuckerberg and more recently mukesh ambani. Everyone is wondering I have modelled my life for success and there are people in other countries who achieve the same things we want just as a part of their process of doing whatever they do! Being unemployed has it's perks I suppose.  

/s Unfortunately it’s Boomer mentality which has passed on to the younger generation too. Indians are well known for ruining work culture in other countries too with unrealistic deadlines and expectations. There needs to be a massive re-education and expectation on how working 16 hours won’t necessarily give the company best results, great ideas and happy employees do. Companies like Elitecore technology expects employees to work more than 100 hrs per week. Without a single rupee of overtime. My life was hell in that company. yeah... the work culture in india is super sucky... 

the look that people get when clock out when the clock strikes 5/6 is actually as if you are stealing money from the mouths of babes...

i know poeple whose boss started looking for a way to fire them, when he saw this attitude... the same boss got super pissed when they took an extra 3 mins for lunch... 

&#x200B;

cray cray... Forget about leisure.. We don't even have the right to take a break between tenure periods from one job to another. if so, the employer has to be satisfied with our reason for a ""break"".

Saala pura system barbaad hai BC... We are following the footsteps of our supreme leader (🥰🥰) who only sleep 3 hours each night. Most of us are working ourselves to death. It's a sad truth and a desperate situation. Work from home has made things worse. I work with a PSU bank, the number of times I have to tell my colleagues to please stop and take a break it's astonishing. 

I mean, I understand the days when the rush is high, but God dammit, Sonia (Indian Susan), for the love of your health, take a break in case of spondylitis and get better. 

I've worked with people who fucking joined back as soon as their covid19 symptoms vanished, because fuck others.

People sitting till 7pm, just because 🤷🏽‍♀️.

I feel what people don't understand is that work will continue to happen, irrespective of you are there or not. One day, you'll retire and then you'd realise that the company you give up your life for, doesn't give a shit about you. At the end of the day, it'll always be your family that'll stand by you. Just spend time with them. Be there and understand your kids and wife. Fuck this mindset k bahiya jaan hi de do apni naukri k lie and a big middle finger to those employers and firms that exploit this mindset."

Americans are as much a good guy as gun toting satan asking you to be his friend or else.. As a Pakistani I dont think we should be blaming the British anymore. Yeah what they did was shitty and harmed but we as South Asians should have been able to resolve our differences and got over it already!!

Look at Europe. They fought 2 world wars with each other and killed millions but for the most part get a long just fine now. Why the fuck cant we? I really cannot just keep saying ""the British ruined everything"". Nah, it was us. We must take responsibility too."
h9f0dx,"I'm a 20M, who graduated from high school about 3 years ago, but almost my entire schooling life was a nightmare for me. 
My family is from bangalore but they moved to gurgaon as soon as i was born, and so I grew up there. I was subjected to casual as well as extreme racism throughout my schooling life. From being made fun of for my surname all the time,to being called names because of my skin colour ,to being the butt of every racist stereotype possible, it just drained my completely. Especially the fact that all this started at a very young age, it affected me a lot. And it was all the time! Sometimes even some of their parents used to pass subtle remarks. I resisted a lot, but it never stopped and the fact that it sometimes intensified after me trying to resist it, made me feel even worse. I was indeed very weak.
I started hating myself to a point that I used to lie to about where I am from and stuff in order to make them think I am one of them. Started creating a new identity so as to seem more north indian. And in that process I lost myself. I used to feel so sad and have such a low self esteem. My parents always used to tell me to be proud of myself,but I just couldn't help it. It broke me so much. 
I'm better now and accepted myself, but all that really has had a huge impact on me as a person. There were many amazing ppl in my school too,but I just never got to be friends with them properly and was stuck.  I was just stuck in a wrong group probably. Have no friends from school now whatsoever,which is sad but im kinda relieved. I'm all for joking and stuff, I make fun of myself all the time, but there's a limit. Parents should teach good values to their kids and make em learn to respect different cultures ,No kid should have to go through this.

Anyways,sorry for bothering. I just wanted to get it out somewhere and I have no one I can share this with. Thanks for reading.",I can't help but think about how much I was bullied in my school for being a South indian in north india.,Non-Political," I can totally relate. I'm ( 19F ) also south indian but I was born in Delhi. I was never really straight up bullied, but I had a Punjabi friend (not a friend anymore) who would often bring me down because of my skin colour. Her mom was also like that. I hated going to her house because the two of them had a way of making me feel ugly without even saying it straight. They would often pass unnecessary comments about the south indian culture like we don't know how to have fun, we're misers, etc etc. This ""friend"" turned out to be really toxic in the upcoming years and I had to completely cut her out off my life. The problem is most kids don't understand that they are bullying someone. It's just fun and jokes for them. I think majority of the blame should be on their parents and teachers. Kids learn from the people around them. If they have shitty parents/teachers who ignore or even positively reinforce such behavior, the kid is definitely going to continue doing it. Hey man sorry for what you want through I have gone through similar things being Sikh a lot of people made fun of my unshorn hair. Honestly speaking the 4 years I spent in South India was some of the best times if my life idk what is the problem with north Indians Hey man, the time you faced, I haven't faced similar, but I know it's tough to live the most important years of your life like that, I was a pretty weak student and kept changing schools, live in hostels since class 6th. Now I'm in college and the best friends I have are from South India (chennai, Kerala, Bangalore, belgaum). Give yourself time mate, great things are ahead :) I was bullied for being fat. I guess these are universal experiences and this has lot to do with upbringing. In adult life too this happens and we call it power equations. I hear you man. As a fellow south indian who grew up in Delhi, it was quite a struggle. I didn't even know I was getting bullied until I joined college. It happened to such an extent I was ashamed of my own name and started saying I am a marathi, so that these morons would stop calling me ""lungi"", ""madrasi"" and so on. I never realized how big of a ghetto Delhi is until I saw bangalore. I didn't even know any Muslim till I was 18. That sheltered the community was where I was staying.   


Any way bro, you ever feel like you need to talk to someone. Hit me up. I will be more than happy to talk to you here on chat or on phone too! I'm Tamil (so no surname which made it even weider ) and I have been to Maharastra and West Bengal.

Students making fun is something u can understand but when the parents start doing the same shit, that's when u get really furious. 
 
I mean they were all educated and rich but still their mind is filled with these inferiority complex.

For context: when I was in West bengal, our school had a fund raising campaign where we were supposed to go and collect money. This is a small town, so half the kids in the neighborhood were in my school and were given the same task. The lady gave every other student decent 50rs donati but when me and my brother went, she gave a 5rs donation while looking at us with a smirk (think 'karen who called the police on the black guy who wrote #blm on his house, that was the smile). It's a very deep rooted problem in our society, from young age kids think it's okay to bully others because it brings you a sense of superiority. Galee ke gunde are basically driven by this same mentality and infact these people become netas too. People only think of bringing others down to get somewhere from young age. I was bullied in class 6-7 horribly, as i can remember, it was not to your extreme, it was physical and mental bullying by the group of ""kool kids"" of the class. Whenever i complained it to my father or mother, they would get even angry at me for not fighting back enough.  
What is more striking is , when i was in class 8, i became the bully myself, and I was way worse, and calculated in my approach. I couldn't bully the strongests that's why i choose weaker than me people. 
This slowly faded away, but until in College i couldn't realize that whatever happened to me and whatever i did were very wrong both. But my father still has this trait of bullying people of lower economic background using his money and power, i hate him for it. [deleted] [deleted] I am sorry you went through this. I have been the exact typical North Indian in my school days and I realize how much fucked up shit I used to say to people with different skin colour. I can't apologize to the people I have done this to and I have stopped seeing people like that."

Yet they're planning to close down the biggest covid care facility in India because it's empty? Bullshit.

Death rate is low? Tell that to the dead. This pandemic is FAR from over but the government is pushing the media to spread lies and make people go back to work. All they care about is the economy and all they want is money.

Yes, I know the economy is important. Yes, I know it's busted and we need to kickstart it. But this isn't the way. Lying, making kids go back to school/college. It just isn't.

What was the point of quarantining for the last 6 or 7 months when we're going to throw it all away and go back to normal as if nothing happened?

He was a good man who took numerous precautions but was called back to office. Now he's gone and left behind a wife and two young children Deaths are being registered as everything but covid. Lowest death rate seems sketchy. Le govt : Jee and NEET exams go brrrr Might I offer you a ~~egg~~ peacock during these trying times?

But for real tho this is just bullshit. Hope your family gets better First off, sorry for the anguish you are experiencing. I wish there were easy answers. Unfortunately India is a lower middle income country that has ignored its public health system since the independence. We should stop comparing ourselves to rich nations and even China which is a much more prosperous country than us. Like you said we don't have a choice but to keep the economy and society running (somewhat) in order to avoid further worsening of the situation. We went into lockdown on advice of many experts both from abroad and here..the attempt was to try to get a handle on the situation and see if in meantime an effective treatment regimen could come up because intensive research was ongoing and there was a small hope to find right combination of drugs that could have altered the trajectory of this disease. I am sure there were other considerations too. It was a sincere attempt to prevent a bad outcome but ultimately it has failed because we still don't have an effective line of treatment or a vaccine. And with our current state of affairs and a large number of poor people we have had to abandon the over cautious approach. To add to this there is a huge mismanagement in hospitals for those who are not suffering covid. I personally know 2 people who passed away due to cardiac and other issue which were avoidable. The could have been alive now had they got proper medical attention in time. Give them dolo dose 2 time per day, vitamin c , citrus fruits and other food that ll provide him strength plus azithromycin 500 for 3 days (1 dose in morning before breakfast nearly 1 hr ) 
And give them alot of liquids India has no future. There. I said it. We’ve been ignoring this statement since independence and still, we’re just modernising. Things are still at the same level. Fuck the economy, military, companies if a person can’t have a decent life if they aren’t rich/powerful/have connections. which city are you?

the largest care facility was outskirts of bangalore, apparently no one wanted to go that far. they had beds but i wonder how many ventilators etc."

About  me I consider all other fields are shit and I only allow him to learn  coding because not to develop skills. The only way to be a millionaire  is by learning coding like Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai. All I care  about is money I want to give a better life for him. And I want to  teach him to judge people based on their financial status because money  is the best thing in the world. If you're doing a low paying job and you  have other skills living your life as per your wish im sorry to say  this please stay away from me and my child. ( you're not eligible to  live)

AT  0- 10 I want him to learn all the programming in this old even dead one  and at the same time he needs to prepare for gov and competitive exams

At 11 - 15 I want him to do an internship in a big MNC

AT 16 I want him to be an entrepreneur with $10mill in his bank account

AT 20 I want him to be the CEO of GOOGLE or FACEBOOK

At 23 I want him to marry a woman from a high profile family ( im very strict in this she must be an Indian)

And  I want him to follow my steps to his children also and in my last, I  want to see my millionaire family surrounding me note: only people with  money in their bank account is allowed if one of his children failed I  will disown him and I will die peacefully.

Class-solidarity. Haven't TN farmers been protesting before COVID? They had been trying to get attention by using skulls and going bare skinned etcetera... If nobody cared then what will make anyone care now? As they say, don't bite the hand that feeds you. Threaten ? As if anyone cares. See how our farmers are treated. At bare minimum no govt official is ready to hold a talk with them. Somehow everyone forgets these while voting Finally, people are raising their voice against the shit gov BJP govt won't hesitate in labeling the taxi union also as a pro-khalistan/pro-muslim union,the same way they labelled all the protesting farmers as khalistanis. All they ever did was to hide from their mistakes and give the issues a religious outlook so they won't have to address the problems. Who’s misleading the taxi drivers now? Finally !! Feeling proud of something in this country. Solidarity to every farmer, taxi driver, working class people of this country.

Bauji is UP-Bihar ke traditionalist bauji. He doesn't have any real achievements so always talks about the glorious past. Bauji doesn't need science, science needs bauji. If you speak anything against bauji, you have become too westernised and uncultured. The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts. - **Bertrand Russell** Tbh he actually warned before the first wave started but the highly EdUcAteD BJPee leaders were busy assaulting  students in campuses. Well, The people have to be *wise* inorder to vote wisely. These People are too clouded by their religious sentiments and are too shallow minded to make a prudent choice. Modi will just create another big PR spectacle in the next 3 years to make up for this huge debacle and, hurray!!!! everybody loves him.... Is this guy a genius? No. Is this guy an idiot? Probably. Is he better than Modi? No fucking doubt.

NEVER EVER re-elect a leader who refuses press conferences and real interviews from real journalists. It shows his insecurities and his incompentecy to face questions. Simply put, he's coward. Those are the basics of democracy. Gambhir and Modi in the next dream 11 ad :

Desh ko main duba Deta hoon… aap dream 11 pe team bana lo. UP elections next year, let's see How about south india join in celebrating the Supreme Leader, Avatar Of Ram, King in The North, President of Dinda Academy. Now who is the Pappu The tsunami he is referring to is yet to come. He is talking about the ""economic devastation"" that is slowly unrolling under the surface now."
lr3ini,,"Delhi High Court: ""The offence of sedition cannot be invoked to minister to the wounded vanity of the governments"".",Politics," How does a citizen raise a petition to a court or whatever

We need to do something about this sedition shit. Both parties cong and bjp have misused this law a lot. The person will rarely be convicted but the main story gets forgotten after the media starts this bakra bullshit. Now two weeks they'll waste on this girl. Should have added a deterrent to doing what they said should not be done. Without consequences this is just a nice sounding statement. I mean it literally can. The judge should spend a year or two in UP.

So what if they eventually get bail. No one wants to spend a week in jail in the first place and then the rest of their life fighting for respite from a bogus case. The process itself is the punishment. Not me but Somebody somewhere asked: Should Disha counter sue the state? Then why are dalit and adivasi climate activities still in jail with Naxal tag? Does justice exist only for upper class social media activists? All BJP ministers who are less educated than 10th standard students understood this well crafted English so well. /s Instructions unclear. Ended up lynching a minority [deleted] ""OK boys, sedition didn't work. Time for UAPA!"" Don't forget this is the same judge who denied bail to Safoora. 

""When you choose to play with embers, you cannot blame the wind"" some words from his judgement. It's literally happening all over the nation Mr judge"
mwpife,,BJP politician feeding gaumutra to a covid patient on a ventilator.,Unverified," Study hard, work your ass off, pay taxes, follow the rules, and be a good citizen...

only to see fucking uneducated, unqualified, shameless and corrupt-to-the-core bastards enjoy all the power and rule over you? Gaumutra or not, important questions are:
1. Why is he feeding a sedated and ventilated patient orally,this can lead to aspiration into the already compromised lungs.
2.where is icu security,hospital management??
3.What is our media doing? Lmao

Imagine you lay there dying, your life flashing before your eyes. And even tho it is your life, you're not the center of your story. Everything you've done in your life has most likely been to facilitate others, your parents, your husband, your children... From the moment you're born, you're life is predetermined. Set on a path to fulfill a role laid out by society and culture. A typical reality for most middle class women in India.

Life is a constant struggle, an everyday battle of attrition against the evil juggernauts scheming to squeeze every paise out of your tightly budgeted purse filled with coins you can't let go cuz as meagre as it is, they eventually add up to something. You haggle with the shopkeeper, you haggle with the vegetable vendor. You make innumerable personal sacrifices becaues that's where you fit in this world.

Meanwhile the shittiest and the most cunning of people assume power thru corruption, nepotism and absolute evilry. They hoard money offshore, routinely fuck the system and abuse it to gain favors and stay in power. No one is held accountable while they peddle their bullshit to a Public that barely has enuf time to spend with their kids or have a moment alone. 

And as you struggle to draw your last breath in this miserable shitshow surrounded by a shitstorm of panic and pain set in a larger maelstrom of shit, your brain barely getting any oxygen to form a coherent thought, a dressed-down, masked-up, agenda-driven politician with the vaccine coursing thru his shit-veins drips literal piss down your intubated throat.

Edit: I opened with LMAO because of the sheer helpless absurdity of it all. There's an undeniable element of dark humor to it. We are living in a black mirror episode set in the twilight zone.

Ps: Thank you for the silver, stranger. 
It's weird seeing a 'wholesome' award on a super depressing post I made when everything felt super fucked up, but I'll take it! Thank you.

Damn! First gold ever. 🙏🙏🙏 [deleted] A dying person on ventilator support is being force fed Gaumutra by these motherfuckers for a photo op to further propogate their religious extremist propaganda, imagine this happening to your loved ones. get this man a place in prison. r/noahgettheboat Something tells me this video is going to stay on the internet for a long time and serve as example for the stupidity of people during covid times. Elect more uneducated Gobar chap's as your representatives.

He represents the society and the mentality of the society that elected him.

I am leaving this country. There is no hope here.

Have to protect my future generation from another great disaster that awaits ""Climate Change""

India and other tropical countries are on the list that will be severely affected by Climate Change.

I am 100% sure there will be no plan in India to tackle that situation as well. There are many deaths to come and many families to be displaced. I pray for the future generation of my country. Another video. They are forcing patients.

irz6se,"My friend's  account here is u/InAbsoluteShambles. He was a school time friend. A kind soul, a bright guy and a most importantly an empathetic man. Time ,college and the hustle of trying to fit here in the real world had done us apart but we'd gotten in touch back again since the past 2 months. He was struggling with his set of mental health issues but he was fighting it with a  certain sense of conviction. He'd started to get back again to doing what he loved- Anchoring and I was hopeful my man was starting to turn around until the tragedy struck. He got infected last week ,admitted yesterday and today morning has left us all and I am hurting. 


In his final days -He told me how he used to post here ,the kind of support he received and how u all helped him in his time of a crisis. On his behalf I would like to say a thank you",Dear kind people of this group.I would like to inform you that my friend who posted about his mental health issues here and got your unwavering support and love has passed away today morning after a tough fight with Corona .,Unverified," I'm really sorry to hear that OP. May his soul rest in peace.

I'm sure you were a great friend to him and I hope you find peace soon too. I know words might not be much right now, but I'm sharing a message that helped me during similar times, originally written by GSnow, here on reddit.

>""Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents. 

>I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see. 

>As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive. 

>In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. 

>Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. 

>Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks. "" May he rest in peace. 
For people reading this, live your life. It's fleeting. Do give this a read: https://np.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/2xc947/text_soon_i_will_be_gone_forever_but_thats_okay [deleted] Maybe I'm going to hell for this, but your writing style matches /u/InAbsoluteShambles to a T. 

Exhibit A: Not ending the very last sentence in a period (On his behalf I would like to say a thank you)

Exhibit B: Use of comma attaching it to the wrong word (""Time ,college"")

Exhibit C: Uncommon and incorrect use of em dash followed by incorrect capitalization of the next word (doing what he loved- Anchoring)

Exhibit D: Interchangeable ""you"" and ""u""

Exhibit E: The likelihood of someone 23 years old dying of COVID is infinitesimally small. I get that family members make up the cause of death to cover for suicides, but considering this went so far as to say ""admitted"" (to the hospital) it's taking the narrative a little to far. 

It is, however, common to fake a death to see what kind of outcome one would receive if they were to actually do it. And so, if this is InAbsoluteShambles, please know this: your death would *devastate* those around you. Strangers included. Get help. Your life is worth living. Don't do this to your family because it will haunt them for the rest of their lives. Holy shit man, he was just 23 and was active on reddit till two weeks ago.

His father lost his job in print media and he himself was struggling with his IT job and was depressed.

Fuck man fuck this shit. Fuck Covid, fuck China.

No old parent deserves to see their dead children. 😭 Damn, this is so heartbreaking. Glad he had a supportive system around him in his final times, people like you and fellow redditors in addition to his own family. 

Condolences to you and his family and I shall keep him in my prayers. I'm sorry. So sorry for your loss. Although I have never come across his posts, I hope he is in a better place now. You are a good friend. Why do all good people die so soon? Even though he was going through a lot, I could see in the comments he made, trying to cheer someone up, maybe help them with their negative thoughts. How is this virus killing people so young, aren't young people supposed to survive this with ease? May his soul rest in peace. We lost a kind soul."
jzyoul,,"Right to live with a person of choice, irrespective of religion, is intrinsic to right to life and personal liberty: Allahabad High Court",Politics," So you mean to say 50-60 year old uncle aunties can't have authority over other individuals life and choices? Preposterous! All the people screaming about love jihad wouldn't lift a finger to help women in abusive marriages with Hindu husbands. It's all about religious pride. Not about the welfare of the followers of religion. then how the hell will bhakts get laid ? Ridiculous that we even need to have this discussion even after 70 years of indian independence. This statement easily applies to same-sex couples as well. Hopefully the court takes the same stand for that issue as well. It's sad that people have to be reminded of this Most personally insulting part to Yogiji is probably the non usage of Prayagaraj. So the warriors against love Jihad should be booked for hate speech? Lmao bhakto ka chutiya katta What's up with lower courts!

Bcoz he has to make 80% believe they are in danger Some bhakts in the comments think this is praising Modi lol Our PM has his priorities set in this order..

Self > Party > Crony Capitalist friends ..

Nothing else matters.. Not even Hindus, his voters or the nation.. Nationalism and Hindutva are just means to keep himself and the party in power so that he can serve his crony friends who sponsor his party and election campaigns.. even hindu working class & labours don't matter to him lol This regime resembles the White Christian Right in the USA who believe everything else is out to get them. But I have NEVER heard any criticism from their camp about the violence against Christian groups who are not White or from economically less deve regions. Just goes to show priorities of both leaderships are essentially same. ""The [crucible of the pandemic](https://time.com/5812394/india-coronavirus-lockdown-modi/) became a pretense for stifling dissent. And the world’s most vibrant democracy fell deeper into shadow."" That's not true. He hates the other 20% and treats them like enemies. His party copied Divide and Rule playbook from East India Company

Under his leadership , they have crafted the art skillfully

Institutions in India which are generally weak ,just crumbled at his mere touch Now OpIndia will find unsubstantiated dirt on him...and be like ""white man cannot make fun of Modi"""

Let’s say Modi resigns from guilt. Then what? BJP is still in the majority: most probably Shah or Rajnath take his place. Shah is already doing a lot of the work from behind the scenes, and Rajnath isn’t anything special. So we would be back to square 1 If Modiji resigns it's a bad, bad idea.

I just found a pdf file/link to all the resources available in the nation by The Uncut team on IG. https://www.theuncutteam.com/covidresources

I hope this helps. I'll update this comment if I find further links.

There are alot of new guides on IG. 

Edit: I tried linking them but I'm not allowed to post direct links here. Can someone please advice me on how can I relay that information here? Step back and think, this thread is asking for a drug, oxygen and basic medical facilities. We should have never reached this stage - this is not normal. Fuck, this is dystopian.

Please take care everyone ❤️   
I wish we could have done better. We failed, but let's not nornalize what's happening right now. It is not people's responsibility to get drugs, beds and oxygen to save their loved ones. I genuinely can’t believe we’re all here asking for oxygen and medicines. This thread shouldn’t have to exist in our country. Fuck. How can a non-Indian American help? I'm horrified by the pictures and news coming out of India! May God/the gods, depending on your belief, be with your country! Does anyone know where i can get oxygen cylinder right now in delhi?
My relative is in desperate need for it, her saturation has fallen to 35. This link was posted by Fridays for future (India). There's a disclaimer please do read it.

Sharing plasma requirement on behalf of my friend - 

My bhaiya is COVID+ and critical. Needs immediate B+ plasma transfusion.The donor should have recovered from COVID in last 5 months and should not be vaccinated. Any blood group will also work. 
Please contact
Alok Bamania +91 85274 47474
Vikas Bamania +91 75036 35380

Please reach out to him if you know any leads 🙏 Doctors of this subreddit, could you please also compile a list of medicines/supplements to be taken if someone is Covid postive?

As someone whose entire family has tested postive, I am hearing n different suggestions from different people. I'm sure this would help other people too. Looking for beds (with oxygen) for 60+ (husband & wife) in Indore.

Oxygen level dropping, doctors have asked to get admitted asap. I recently recovered from Covid. Want to donate plasma. After how many days can I donate? Process?"
jw89j0,,India’s WhiteHat Jr is startup hell,Business/Finance," Do NOT paste the article in comments. That would be a copy right violation. If you want to read the article, sign up at the website. If you don't want to sign up, don't read.

Edit: The article is free btw, requires only sign up. Finally, an article that does not mince words at the issue. Absolutely immoral and disgusting behaviour by WhiteHat Jr. It's so much worse when the facts are laid out, no spin required. Wow. 

Whitehatjr sounds more like a Criminalhat. 

What a shithole!

Edit: Pretty sure their ORM team is reading this. If you are, here is one of your competitors which is actually useful.


https://www.khanacademy.org/ Kudos to 'The Morning Context' for publishing this. Almost everybody following startups, tech space knew about this toxic startup, but very few raised their voice. It's no longer a secret that they abuse and voice down every single critic. I'm considering buying subscription of Morning context now. It's a long article, but well worth the read. Those who can, share this as much as possible. I just wonder, what magnitude of positive impact they could've had if they decided to not go down the shithole path and actually create a legitimate platform... They had such a brilliant opportunity and all the resources they needed :( I'm gonna bet this website will be taken down in the next 3-4 hours. #WhiteHatMyAss OMG! just read this on ""freepressjournal.in""

""He said his two Reddit accounts have been suspended permanently, one twitter account, two youtube accounts, 16 videos removed from youtube, and one Quora account temporarily suspended.""

Seems so outrageous and kinda hard to believe actually, but if someone has to fight so hard to express an opinion, there has to be some truth to it. Hi everyone! If you are looking for free kids coding, please go to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu./) . It was developed at MIT and its free! Over 20 million kids around the world use it and over 70% schools in the US use it as a CS education curriculum. Its put together by one of the best teams. I know because I work there.

hp2bgk,,"BJP Blocks Parliament Panel Review Of PM CARES Fund, Coronavirus Response",Politics," I remember when people were protesting Aadhar for privacy reasons, and bhakts were telling us, if you have done nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide. Unsurprisingly, they are not willing to apply this same 'logic' to their beloved sarkar. In a year's time or 6 months' time, BJP will have had enough time to falsify paper trails on how the money was spent (patriotically, of course). They will then release this false narrative to media as ""Gotcha"" to liberals and vindication for sanghis. Make no mistake, this is a calculated block on several levels. 

Remember, there is no better time to profit than in a crisis. Mitron Transparency will be top priority of NDA government The amount of effort they are putting in blocking any attempt towards examination of PMCARES just confirms suspicions. Condolences to all the files lost in the fire...

Oh, not yet? I'm too early. 

Fine. Remind me when it happens.  Thanks. ye naya india he. Modi is so honest /s Daal meh kutch kala hai. what is their official excuse? sorry, I am out of the loop.

EDIT: Article says: ""The government has said the PM CARES Fund, set up as a war chest for national emergencies to draw individual and private sector donations, will not be looked into by the government's auditor but by ""independent"" auditors.""  

what a pathetic excuse. So the people heading the government don't want Government Auditors. This is too bad, like they didn’t even think about the optics of this. I don't understand how people are okay with the goverment not telling US about the PM cares fund, but when congress does it, everyone loses their mind. I mean, they both are doing the same thing. How is it acceptable for BJP?"

How the “Modia” becomes an arm of the gobermint.  

So sorry for spelling mistakes , English is not my first language . 😂 I think we give lot of credit for loads of things to Modi than he deserves...

Media, I mean do you really think, Likes of Sudhir Chaudhary, Navika Kumar or even Arnab Goswami have any guts to stand up against any Government? So spineless, pliable, sold outs that any Government in power can twist their arms. 

And Modi, He is not even from Delhi to get hold of these News networks... It was Arun Jaitley in first term who had contacts & control over Delhi based news networks... And now, They don't need to be controlled at all... Remember, 'Spineless, pliable, sold outs'... 

Modi is For Show, people love his Image, his glowing skin, designer cloths (I don't know how many of you noticed but he has stopped wearing Nehru or Modi or whatever its called jacket these days), his fake confident demeanour give Hero worshipping people something to look at... Other than that, I really don't think there is major role he gets to play! I mean come on, Guy has ideas like 'Clouds can fool Radars' and 'Make oxygen from thin air using windmill'... Preposterous! 'They' don't even let him speak to media ffs... 

'They' means, some selected few From RSS & BJP who must be Upper cast (read as Brahmin, Who back in says played same roles for Kings & Powerfuls), Few from Administrative services and some staunch nationalist who are not affiliated to RSS but are just nationalist, to play such smart politics...

Hence, Liberals, Opposition especially Congress should stop targeting Modi only, cause he is shameless thug and tbh his reputation is unshakeable, Target other leaders in BJP, his ministers like Farm Minister Tomar for such huge fuck up, Or N Sitharaman for downtrodden economy, ask for their heads... Why The fuck always target Modi? It is just not the media. Even the judiciary is now becoming a tool of the government to push it's agenda and release it's dogs from jail. replace the remote with knife u get a pewdiepie meme template How long until they come for this magazine?  Guess who will soon be getting raids from CBI IT & ED. Guys I highly suggest you purchase this article or magazine if you can. I read it and it's very well written.

javbeg,,Exhausted nurses after a shift in a Dedicated Covid hospital in Odisha. I swear we don't thank them enough. These guys are awesome. (posted here with consent). Will be indebted to them all my life for taking care of my pappa.,Coronavirus," The real life Super Heroes🙏🏼 I feel sad for these nurses. These nurses are overworked and often underpaid for their services. 

These are true heroes of our society. Working day after day when they know there is a risk of infection and not stopping or backing down. I wish government would give something else than just thanks to them. They are not making more, just doing more work. Maybe a tax break or something. I know this is not the place but I don't have anywhere else to turn now. 
I am a Student Nurse. I am halfway through my degree. We are being forced to work without any sort of Payment. And we are being threatened by Administration. If we do not provide service we will be Terminated from course. We knocked all the doors but there is no use. The Administration Sucks. 

But I am happy I could provide some service, for which I have no regrets. People need Help. We do too. They ask where is GOD? I say here they are choosing this profession and risking their lives to save others. 

I hope those idiots who beat doctors come to their senses. Also glad Central Govt. recently passed a bill of strict punishment if a doctor suffers violent treatment from patients family. To the men and women in scrubs, 

Lots of thanks & lub, 

From a useless little bub. Big salute to the heroes, god bless them A big thank you with a big smile. A large Thankyou to these heroes.

Please show them all these comments and threads thanking them. You are correct, we don't thank them enough. True Heroes! Huge respect! It makes my heart break with shame and guilt. I’m extremely angry we as citizens have not ever demanded better from our leaders in healthcare. Fuck better, we’ve not demanded anything. 

Maybe if we had, it wouldn’t have come to this today."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/india) if you have any questions or concerns.* My dad passed away a few days ago and next day I went to the burning ghat (in Kolkata). It is a famous one and has around 8 electric burners dedicated to covid bodies. I saw around 100 bodies kept there when I arrived (my dad's arrival number was 93). I was standing outside to get some paperwork and within 40 mins I stood there I saw around 1 body a minute arriving there. I asked the security guard he said the previous day there were around 200 bodies cremated. 2 days later when I went to get the death certificate, they told me 270 bodies were cremated the previous day. 200+ bodies cremated each day in a single ghaat in Kolkata, imagine the total in the city itself and then imagine the numbers country wide. The official numbers are an insult to the people dying. Last few days I've enough dead bodies to last me atleast 10 lives. It's bloody sad. Even if you account for daily average death for those 71 day, which would come to some 88k deaths. That's still some extra 35k deaths out of which only about 4218 are counted as covid deaths, that means only 1 in every 8 covid death is getting reported. #Government Lied, People Died...

There is no better way to put it than this. Since the First wave Government hid the numbers, lied to public... In the wake of spreading positivity, not to create panic and to hide international shame, Government Lied, kept public in dark about grim situation and that made public overconfident which further led to such big, colossal Mayhem! Translation

How many people died from corona in Gujarat? The government does not want to answer this question. Confused by Morbid and Co-Morbid statistics, Gujarat has been given the answer by the government departments themselves. Between March 1, 2021 and May 10, 2021, the government recorded 4218 deaths from corona in government records, but 1,23,871 death certificates were issued in 33 districts and eight corporations in the state. The figures of death certificates that have come to us are shocking.

According to death certificates, 26026 deaths were reported in the state in March this year and 57796 deaths in April. In the first 10 days of May, the figure rose to 40051. If we compare these figures with the same months of 2020, there were 23352 deaths in March 2020, 21591 in April 2020 and 13125 in May 2020. That means the death toll in the first 71 days of this year is twice as high as last year.

\^Table \^formatting \^brought \^to \^you \^by \^\[ExcelToReddit\](https://xl2reddit.github.io/) GUJRAT Model !! post this in every sub please, let's respect the dead by first acknowledging their death Around ~27600 people die in India every day. 

In Gujarat this would translate to 1240 death/day (Gujarat has around 4.5% of India’s population).

Gujarat has had 1.23 L seats in 71 days; or around 1700 deaths per day.

This means Gujarat has seen ~39% increase in deaths due to COVID. 

Edit: Reporting suggests a far higher increase in death vis-a-vis normal. There is a high probability that municipal corporation’s are not reporting data accurately.

Edit: Mortality rate in India is 7.2 / 1000 / Yr. I wish I could say that I am surprised but I'm not. The government is lying. The sad thing is that they will not acknowledge it. We have to force them to. iNdIa hAs a lOwEr dEaTh pEr mIlLiOn rAtE CoMpArEd tO DaE WeSt Hopefully BJP govts donot try to  fudge death certificates data.. idk whether its even possible but you may never know ... death certificates are the only way to comprehend the scale of this tragedy espically in states like UP bihar gujarat which are deliberately coercing hospitals and testing firms and crematoriums to massively underreport data

&#x200B;

As per the data given in the news there are roughly 65000 death certificates issued in excess over the previous yr during the same months. Only 4000 deaths of those excess 65000 counted as covid officially... WOW.. even if we discount 20000 deaths of those excess deaths  as normal causes which is of course absurd assumption , there will still be 40000 deaths unattributed.. and if all were covid then we record just 1 death officially for every 10 covid deaths in gujarat

n30ew0,,Rahul Kanwal: BJP cant get away with everything,Politics," AIADMK losing because of BJP. Literally everyone I know is voting against AIADMK because of their alliance with BJP Nobody has ever gotten away with massive blunders. BJPs grasp on the general public will rot as they mainly use cultural and societal issues, not economic ones. Didi-o-didi thrashed bjp. None of the exit polls I saw had her winning with such a large margin. 205 is a right beating.

Time for Mahua and Derek O’Brian to move up and appeal to the youth, moderates and grab the space which the likes of AAP have not been able to leverage They already have.

They've positioned themselves as the party that says either you're with Hindu's or against them.

They've taken out policies and social changes. They don't matter to them and their supporters. It's good to see that people saw the real face of BJP.
West Bengal: TMC
Tamil Nadu: DMK
Kerala: LDF
Everywhere BJP has lost, but I can guarantee that they haven't learned anything from this. BJP will blame Bangladeshis/muslims for the loss in Bengal.

They won't learn - they can't.

Learning would require them to accept that ""Ram"" does not work all the time, that is too much to ask from BJP. Mamta should be calling narindar now. Feku o feku. They are playing GoT theme music during headlines 🤦‍♀️

ja8tiq,,"I don’t want my child to inherit an India built on hate, says Rajiv Bajaj",Politics," Bajaj boycott incoming. I am still waiting for a day where these RSS buffons start trending boycott petrol/diesel from Muslim soil... 

It will never happen... Hamara Bajaj This is exactly what I always tell to the bhakts.. I tell them that, their actions are making sure that their own kids will inherit an India full of hate, fear and no opportunities.. Like clockwork, you can expect blue tick no names on twitter like that bitch Shefali Vaidya or that asshole Rishi Bagree to start digging up unrelated bullshit from the past, post colorful factually incorrect infographics manufactured by the minions of bjp sweatshops, and send their rabid dogs/followers on bajaj any time now. Twitter was a mistake. Chaliye Bajaj ko vanakkam... So we are done with Bollywood now and move on to businesses that have not supported the government. Tanishq by Tata, bajaj, the power cut in Mumbai that mysteriously happened without any actual reason and Tata's name out (I'm pretty sure people didn't care where their electricity came from before this) are all anti national but we know that reliance, patanjali are the most patriotic of the lot. The international companies are not invited in this party I suppose.
People trending boycott for everything is so funny and can't be taken seriously anymore. I mean really if I want to buy jewellery from tanishq that's a personal choice and I'm not going to care about an ad. 
If people really had such pride I wonder why there are so many Tommy Hilfiger stores running successfully across the country especially after the man himself told that he hates the country and wouldn't have made his products if he knew Indians would buy them. But we obviously don't have time to worry about that. Who cares if we a country lose respect globally as long as we keep the tensions alive within.
Btw while this is going on, the Chinese army has occupied the northern boundaries of our country. i already want to get out. i don’t feel very safe here since i’m lgbt (not the same group but still hate) and i’m also unsettled by the hate towards other groups too. i don’t get discriminating based on caste, religion, country, etc. it’s dumb. Massive respect for Bajaj. To say this is to have balls of steel in this new India of BJP. Hats off to Rajiv Bajaj. I wish more people come out and say this. This might sound rude but these guys didn't stop the ads because of hate. Hate is being spread from these channels for years now. They have to be extremely stupid to say they just saw it now. They are removing ads because Republic was defrauding them showing fake TRP numbers. Now they know Republic's popularity was a lie and no one will give ad to such channels. ""Want to stop Hate and propaganda"" is a completely ridiculous excuse to give after they have funded so much damage to the nation knowingly."

We have been told it is **1 in Million probability to find a match**. It is number game, the more people take the test, the better chances we have of finding a match. So, we need to test at least half **a million people to find a match**, but every few people have come forward? Why? Because no heard about **""STEM CELL DONATION"" or have heard, but still unwilling.**

I'm getting that feeling right now. How one counter any argument when any policy is made keeping in the mind the subject of National Security but will diminish the freedom aspect in that particular field? Nearly everything is justified nowadays just by mentioning ""in the interest of National Security"", how the hell can one rationalise on this without sounding what some call ""Anti-National""? tldr; Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has issued new guidelines for holding online conferences and seminars on subjects related to ""security of State, Border, Northeast states, UT of J&K, Ladakh or any other issues which are clearly/purely related to India's internal matter/s"". Under the new guidelines, all ""central educational institutions, publicly-funded universities"" will have to get prior approval from MEA if they want to hold online international conferences or seminars.

ms0d5x,,Where is your mask?,Coronavirus," Kumbh devotees want the kumbh to handle their karma so nirvana is achieved.

The name Khiladi is lowkey perfect for him Ironically Thackeray is also an opportunist. He has used his power for silencing any voice against him. 

Canadian Khiladi is just doing the best thing that he is good at -  sucking Modi's ""Aam"". He is very close to Sachin and his family from way back. The statement makes sense. We don't want Canadians meddling with our internal matters.

Now 'The Daily Guardian' will make its debut and accuse The Guardian if spreading fake news. Indian government didn't give the serum institute a single paisa.. not a single cent... checkmate anti-nashunal atheists! They allocated and gave way ₹900 crores for Covid to god knows who.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/news/rs-900-crore-allocated-for-covid-vaccine-development-fm-sitharaman/videoshow/79197633.cms

Central government has given in writing to supreme court that they did not spent a cent on r&d 

https://www.livemint.com/politics/policy/no-aid-given-for-vax-devp-centre-to-sc-11620672443048.html Serum institute is the license manufacturer, right? The research was done by AstraZeneca, and India might have made a small contribution in R&D. 

Still, SII wasn't given the money to ramp up manufacturing initially, and got some 3500 crores after a lot of begging, out of 80,000 crores.

Saw this in Ravish Kumar's report on [May 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9qJ--DLf8I). He also did a [follow-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZV5h3zB1tA) on the reality of budget allocation for manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines. But first, lemme take a selfie 🤳 Have not seen the beard , Modi willed the vaccine into existence by concentrating heavily while standing on one foot , that's why you barely see him during the pandemic. Ah, the OG Guardian. Bhakts will say this is fake news The Daily Guuardian soon ""Mudiji personally chaired a meeting about vaccine manufacturing, mudiji is working very hard"" Do not believe rumours."

(First and foremost, I must thank Narendra Modi, for he did not get me off the helicopter mid-air despite being upset.) lol he looks anxious Why isn't this splashed on mainstream media? This is the much needed booster shot he needs right now./s

(Also, the video badly needs subtitles) Hahaha, so this is how you shut Modi up. Make him sit in front of a journalist.

No wonder the first thing BJP did was to silence/buy media. This is why he's  shit scared of facing journalists  and has totally  changed how media functions. anyone know who is the journalist ?  
also the comment section had some people hating the journalist , these fking andhbhakts   


remember recent modi resignation petition, it was signed by 8lakh people in 2 days.  
Can we have another petition demanding modi's interview with ravish kumar ?

The people supposed to man these institutions of accountability are by law, in one way or another, under the thumb of the executive. 

Many were themselves members of the executive for many decades and have inherited its attitudes. Others are subjected to processes like background investigations and approvals that are mandated by the constitution but given responsibility to the executive.

Our constitution has some structural faults regardless of character of people upholding it. It's already failed to authoritarianism twice in 7 decades and is likely to continue to fail in future decades. There are two pillars to screw people and only one to protect us, and even that one depends on the first two to enforce its judgements. 

It's time to review the basic structure of constitution and learn lessons from better governed democracies like proportional representation, stronger federalism, perhaps another independent protective pillar where sections of people are directly involved. Aaaaantiiiiinashnaaaalllll Sir please use treadmill for walks and workout. The better Shah Wow this is comprehensive and hits the nail on the fucking head.. I read these headlines, and I always think we're talking about the USA. Stay safe It feels like the world is just falling apart lately, as an American I hope for the best for you guys in India. We're both really putting our democracies to the test. People should change the way they vote for candidate. Whenever and whoever I talked to is seems like they vote based on their cast. You say something bad (in sense of how that CM/PM is running the state/country) about their favourite candidate, they will beat you down by saying “you’re of another caste/religion that’s why you don’t like him/her” or “who’s you think can run better government than him?” Etc. 

I know it’s really hard to think rationally and avoid personal liking and aligning with the ideology and caste/religion etc. but aren’t we more educated than our previous generation. We know better and we can understand better. Only if people try, they can see that this politics is just making us to suffer. No any politician is going to get affected by this because their children are already settled in US or UK.

Why wasn't the whole of BJP called a den of rapists when sengar case was going on? 

Seeing whatever is happening with the SSR case, I wouldn't be surprised if it came to light that BJP had conspired to assassinate SSR so that they can use it against all the whole liberal Khan market bollywood gang later on. 

Only the anti CAA protesters and JNU sympathisers from bollywood are being targeted by government in drugs case.

Edit: Kangana Ranaut who herself had admitted to having been a drug addict years ago is being touted as the ideal empowered woman fighting against patriarchal society single handedly. Why?","If all in bollywood are called druggies then why aren't all in politics called rapists, murderers and scammers?",Politics," To your question, most politicians are default assumed to be criminals, specially in India. An ""honest politician"" is considered to be an oxymoron. Distraction is the name of the game. Unfortunately it's not an Indian phenomenon. Trump has been using it effectively in US. Putin was an expert at it on the world stage. With the amount of resources to spread news, they are able to control the narrative as they like. But it can't be a long ploy. Already we are seeing the pushback from people in mann ki baat responses.
With a strong opposition, next elections would have been tough for BJP, but then we don't have a solid opposition. Isn't it just Ganja though? What is the big deal? It is legal in 6 cities in India.

He contracted the virus because of the government.

He wasn't protected by a vaccine because of the government (only had 1 dose).

And if god forbids anything happens because of the collapsing health infrastructure - it will be because of the government and their mismanagement of a fucking pandemic.

He followed all precautions to the best and still got infected. ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ Take care of your dad bro, hope he recovers soon Sorry about your dad and wish him a speedy recovery.

My Jija (cousin's husband) contracted it and had a narrow escape because of the same reason. His work could be done remotely, but they forced him and his colleagues to work at their office.

I also have three other friends who work for the central government, and are commutig to work every alternate day. They happen to be the ones I grew up with. I feel ghastly. be strong & take care of your family.


I hope your father will recover fast Hugs op... Prayer for dad.... Take care [deleted] Hang in there brother. I’m sure that you’ll be writing a post about how your dad beat the bloody hell out of this virus in the next few days. Until then stay safe. Remember health minister said on 7th march that it was covid endgame then. Whole party celebrated it as covid was over. This was the leve of preparation. Same situation. Papa is also a Central Govt employee who was forced to attend office in Delhi as WFH was not 'possible'. Bull fucking shit as the work was accounts related. Doesn't matter if you have comorbidities. He got covid and so did my mother who is ill now (luckily self isolation has been sufficient, so far)

Fuck this govt seriously. Like calling people at office 5 days a week despite the fucking pandemic. I am never working for any govt organisation in my life, one thing is for sure. I also can't understand anyone who still supports this govt. after this shitshow

During the first wave, one of my father colleagues was hospitalised and was lucky to come alive. And guess what, he was still forced to come office just after a month!

Sick fuckers People voted for 'ram mandir' and not essential stuff like healthcare and education.expecting something more is unreasonable and pointless from the current government as they gave proved themselves incompetent is several events."
mqoypd,"Initially byju raveendran marketed himself as serial CAT topper and found out that people can spend money on education. His main base was manipal university from where many of his initial employees were hired.Infact, the chief of sales, the number two in byjus is from manipal. He is like that spectacle fellow in wolf of wall Street.The company, despite results, marketed itself as a very popular and successful CAT coaching. Byju was himself a very good orator, who showed a few mathematics tricks to the audience, and people started thinking that he is teaching them for CAT. People were simply paying him to watch him speak. 

Now, after funding, and expanding to school education, they have clearly understood child psychology. The child will never get a tablet for gaming or porn from parents, but only for education. Behind a child insistence of buying the courses is the greed of getting a tab for playing games or porn.They were also contacted by third party loan NBFCs, who have the power to affect CIBIL scores. One of The real tests of a good salesman is that whether he will forge the customers signature on loan papers on not.Many people in byjys are capable of that. The scam begins from getting the contact numbers from any way possible e.g.banks, schools, hospitals etc. Even after uninstalling the  tab, they will ask about reason of uninstallation. The salesmen are trained to check the credit worthiness of the customers by watching the cars they have to the locality they reside in.If you install byju app from iPhone, you will be quoted higher than someone who installs from Android.They have a very good business where they sell discarded tablets for ten times markup.Once the customers signs on the loan papers (they can forge it as well) , they will listen to the customers  for 15 days during the refund period.The sales man can even demand money for visiting, if someone is not agreeing to buy(which goes into his pockets).If the customer is hesitant to buy the product, they will tell things about not being a good parent in front of the child. They are motivated to tell any lie and provide any hypothetical service to sell the product. No media will write about them. Rather the media will tell about how byju was a tuition teacher who became billionaire. 

Overall, byju classes is a sales and marketing lesson about how a mediocre product can be sold. They are the 'wolf of wall street's of India.Neither of byju raveendran or other top shots of byjus are on Twitter because they know that they will be questioned. Search for byjus on Twitter and sort by recent, every person has the same complaint about not getting the refund.",How byjus scams people,Business/Finance," Wow, what a prick! He deserves to be exposed on the media, but wait.....Media, Cricket, Bollywood all have been bought off by BYJUs. I spent 1hr each day for a week asking these salespeople to stop calling me. They called my dad too and wasted his time. This wasn't Byju's but their higher ed platform which is ment for grad students CareerLabs ig

Tip for students: 

**Please don't give your phone number or email to companies that'll use it for promotional purposes**

Use minimum 3 email IDs.

* Personal: Should be given to friends, relatives & services like Banks, bills etc

* Professional: Only for educational/work purposes

* Burner: For all the promotional crap. You'll be in a situation where you'll be asked to give your email but you know it will be used to annoy you. Use this They conducted a state wide quiz in Kerala schools, in association with Asianet channel. After the 1st round Asianet tried to contact these people to conduct next rounds. But Byjus never responded. They got what they wanted. Data of students, parents occupation, address etc.  The data was worth millions. It was one of the cheapest tricks from their sales team. Only in india they can pull out such a scam. Raveendran is the son of a teacher my fam knows. I wish someone had the ability to make this shady business known to people who think he walks on water. I've heard his base is NY now and they're pals with Zuckerberg. Gives me chills how obsessed Zuckerberg has gotten with Indian market, the creep. 

Pradeep Poonia vs Whitehat since Byju acquisition is an eye opener. Fuck Byjus. Petition to rename Byjus to Gaand Juice. Keeping aside all the dirty work from Byjus, i also think a part of the blame should fall on the society. It is not an essential commodity that he is selling. You can find educational stuff from conventional texts or from the profound knowledge database aka internet.

It is the fear of failing or feeling of insecurity that other students might outscore your children that lead to mass subscriptions.

Considering the way boomers and millenials were taught, the education system has become much better with smart classes and stuff. 

As long as the demand is high the seller keeps the wheel moving. Only if the demand starts to fall then the seller will rethink about the service quality. We should start a crowd funded ad campaign against such organizations who are playing with a child's dream and their parent's money. Ok. So how much time before you think this post will go down ?

I'll go first. 3 days. Byjus will rule the country one day. A dystopian India where Byjus controls everyone. I graduated in 2019 from Manipal and our recruitment coordinator was pushing everyone for byjus, they paid the most (6LPA iirc) and the job was easy, sales and teaching.

The work was so demeaning and menial that I dont know anyone who stayed for longer than 6 months, rather taking lesser paying jobs related to their fields. Make another post by replacing b*jus with bichoo .

gqy525,"I am a streamer on Facebook and have quite some followers(5k). I am a girl. Started streaming past 8 months after 12th. A few days back, my friend sends me a pornhub link, and what I found completely shocked me. Someone made a compilation of my Insta pics and was jerking to it. It made me go numb, anxious and I cried. I beg that friend not to tell anyone. I couldn't sleep since then and all my days turned extreme gloomy. I can't imagine my mum or dad's reaction if they found out that by any means.  My parents noticed my behaviour and asked as well. I found it soo disturbing, I am depressed and have no will to live now. The next day after I found that video, I searched my name in reddit, and I found my pics on some 'jerk off' pages, and people there were commenting soo pathetic violent sexual things about me and many other(Talking about what they will do with me) that was horrifying and unsettling. IDK why some men are so disgusting and destroy someone's life just for their fun. Made me break down. I can't talk about it and especially complain cause it will make it more public. I deactivated my insta since then, and though there were no revealing pics of mine.  
I don't know what to do now. I can't ignore it. This makes me dead from the inside, and it feels so heavy on me that I can't bear it. I can't express how broke and helpless I feel through my words.",My Pics were used for pornographic content and I don't know what to do.,Unverified," First of all, report the videos on those pornographic sites, they will take down videos as soon as possible. And also the reddit mods are ready to take down pictures if they are found to be violating or misusing images. That should help you with the issues. Also use google image reverse look up to find the extent of your images being spread.

And about the longevity of those images staying on internet. It is going to stay for a long time. But, only hope is it will be buried along with all other content generated everyday. 

Sad reality about internet is that you cannot expect to get on it with your real identity find it not being misused by one or the other. Other anonymous people on internet don't care about the consequences hence such malice behavior. 

I know its easier said than done but, remember those pictures are just your normal pictures. You just stumbled upon those comments and video and found it to be disgusting, other wise you would have continued with streaming. Many streamers found themselves in such situations themselves but they have come to terms with it and dismissed it saying, ""they are just themselves, people will do whatever they want, they can't stop all of them"". Check dmca, it might help in taking down the content as well.
[DMCA](https://www.dmca.com/) Here are somethings I would suggest in the order of priority. 

1. You can request the sites to take down the content. 
2. Attend a trauma counseling and talk out about it.(this is must)

These disgusting actions are side effect of gaining fame, beauty and name. It is common practice of jerking off to actresses and celebs(not justifying it). So you can either accept, be aware of it and learn to deal or give up on being famous. 

Lastly, I am sorry on behalf of human kind. May I just add. You have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing okay? I know this may not seem like much compared to the fear of family finding out and the things they might say. But in your heart, I need you to know that this NOT YOUR FAULT. In no way should you feel the slightest bit ashamed. 

That person who made the video is pathetic. Imagine what kind of a loser a person must be to upload himself wanking to a stranger's pics. 

The fact that you feel you have a lot to lose shows how much more dignified and respectable you are. Don't let anyone take it from you. 

You have received plenty of good advice here. I'd try to report the issue asap but I understand if it feels overwhelming at this point of time. Take care of yourself right now. You did nothing wrong. The creep who did this has nothing on you. Warm hugs OP.


ETA: Please please don't let the actions of a few decide your life for you. The weirdos here saying you shouldn't post your pictures are part of the problem. Ignore them. You did nothing wrong and you don't have to delete your social media unless you want to for personal purposes. Don't give this creep the power to dictate how you use social media. 

OP you aren't the first person nor will you be the last this happens to. Report it. Get help for your mental status. I'll be happy to provide some mental health therapist's information if you DM me. Don't give in. Just don't. How did your friend find that video.. many a times it's probably someone you know Report the videos under personal information identification act they will remove everything of yours and stay strong, your life is much more valuable than some other jerk . [deleted] You can request the sites to take down. But once your pics have gone online, it would be resurfacing every now and then it's the sad reality. Grow a thick skin, change social media handles so no one can look you up, change the dp so that now one can find you. I'd advice not to visit pornhub its almost useless.

There's another thing you have to understand when you are using social media it's not private so act accordingly. Relax, this is tough for you I'm sure but it's not as bad as things can be on the internet (deepfakes, photoshopped images, etc). There is no involvement implied on your part in any of these videos. No one coming across these videos would think any less of you as this is just some pervert in your social circle jerking off to a girls pics.

Like the other commenters said, get these images removed from these sites as much as you can. If these images come on top in google search results for your name, which I bet they won't if you have a number of legitimate social media accounts, then you have ways to get them removed or push them down to like the second page of google where no one looks.

Most of all, try not to worry too much about this. I know it's easy to say, but I get the impression that you think anyone coming across these videos will have a different image of you than before. You need to know that's not true. Anyone coming across these videos will only think a popular girl is getting cyberstalked by a perv. Nothing more. Wait till they use those streaming videos to train an AI and use deepfake to create your 100% real looking porn video. 

This doesn't require a degree in computer science, anyone can do this with a pc and and app called DeepFake (Google deepfake porn).

If you search, you will find that porn websites are littered with porn videos of popular ASMR streamers and gaming streamers on YouTube. Reason? Streaming videos are best to train an AI and so you can make perfect looking videos. Believe me you can't tell if it's fake.

Bottomline is that, when you expose yourself to streaming and such things, you accept this ugly truth. Obviously, this is completely wrong and culprits must be given strictest punishment but this doesn't mean such things won't happen to you.

Please report all those places, and take some break. Understand that all models, social media girls and actresses and such people have such jerkoff pages made on them, and they know it but they try to not be bothered by it. This is only way you can continue with your hobby. Learn to ignore such stuff. Hello there. I am a lawyer.I am working with another lawyer in creating a resource to help people like you whose photos were misused.   We are real lawyers and we would be happy to help you take action. Feel free to reach out to me.

I will help you file anonymous complaint with the National women commission or with the cyber police. Don't let those fuckers who misused your photos get away. **Take action, stay strong.**"
jpujff,,"[Old] Biden seeks restoration of peoples’ rights in Kashmir; disappointed with CAA, NRC",CAA-NRC-NPR," I dont think he will issue this kind of statement now as  POTUS. Old news, people will say 100 things in opposition, once they get power they understand the situation and keep quiet.

Obama couldn't close Guantanamo bay, end Iraq war, etc Biden views will be inline with American foreign policy after the election, apart from a tweet or two they wont get involved in kashmir or CAA/NRC. To be honest india wont be in their radar it will be all about middle east, china , carona, economy and stuff like that which matters to em I am waiting to see how Biden led America interacts with Modi led India. [removed] America does not have friends, America has interests. And there is no interest or incentive in Kashmir, CAA/NRC for America. Forget what they say during the campaign, or what party the President belongs to, the foreign policy always remains the same. I don't think this means anything now. I'm glad to know that there is a better person ruling the USA now, but I doubt he's gonna do anything about this. 

Btw, Modi was a fucking idiot to support trump's re-election. It's always a bad idea to take sides in a foreign country's election. Now he won't say anything about kashmir, he must have forgotten about it. USA voted in an election which was the final battle for its soul and made a choice which takes the country forward. India was in exact same position 2019 and chose to take the country backwards. He's gonna be the POTUS now and he'll need to have good relationship with Modi and vice-versa. He might push a little but will be mostly out of Indian politics like literally EVERY American President if it doesn't benefit him. People expecting a foreign leader to make reforms to Indian internal policies are pipe dreaming. I don't like CAA-NRC and treatment of Kashmiris by this administration.

But Biden or any other foreign leader should have zero say on these issues. These are our Issues our policies and we Indians alone should deal with them"

To be honest what Yogi said was right bihar was always backward when during lalu s regime but I can say that things change in our village in bihar(vaishali) I remember when our village almost had no electricity and our road was poor when had no toilets when had to  open defecate in fields  but after we voted for modi things truly changed like now we literally  do not have any power cuts now every house in our village has a toilets and our roads are now good  I remember when the ladies in our house had to collect cowdung firewood

mwvsnf,"Kejriwal showed the balls of steel to get the meeting with PM telecasts live on news channels.

He put forth his disappointments on how the delhi's quota for oxygen is not being fulfilled by center.

The situation is really fucked up in delhi from lat 3-4 days. It is not because of rising covid cases but due to non availability of medical grade oxygen. The hospitals are refusing patients   admissions due to this.

The thing is Delhi does not have its own oxygen plant. And oxygen is managed by center, so state cannot buy it.


The state cm asked Center to increase its quota to 700 MT. The center agreed only for 480 MT.  So at-least Delhi should get 480. But the trucks are being stopped at UP and Haryana borders by the respective states police. Now, the transport of oxygen is also under the Center. They are not able to fulfil their agreement.

The drama is going over in Delhi HC. Every hour one hospital is filing a plea for urgent need fo oxygen.

Why the fuck center is not able to keep its promise? They can deploy army right , for smooth transport of oxygen. Why the fuck they have to wait till someone makes hue cry to get working.

This live telecast really showed how desperately Delhi needs oxygen and how helpless are Delhi and other states CM in this case.


I really hope Kejriwal can manage this crises as there is not hope from our beloved bearded man.  For him elections are more important than governance.

If kejriwal wanted it , he would fucking destroy this  fake imagery of modi on his own.

So what if Delhi CM highlighting acute oxygen shortage to nation’s PM is televised to nation?

Spoils record of carefully orchestrated PR exercises?   No apologies are due from HCM Delhi.

This is where [modi brings up ""protocol""](https://youtu.be/I1VdbZROoNQ) Virgin modi vs Chad Kejru Any live telecast basically exposes the hollow narrative of his 56 inch chest. Nothing wrong in what Kejriwal did. Modi is just a coward Hey can you point to a link something related to the NGT order. I have not been able to find one. Apparently there was no protocol about telecasting before today..heck modi has been telecasting his own speech from similar meetings since the covid began with certain news channel..kejriwal knew his speech would not be televised,only modis which is why he took it upon himself by sharing the link. Modi is such an insecure person, has a delicate and fragile ego and is so easily threatened. This man-child just wants sycophants around. As much as I love the fact that Kejriwal took this approach and did what he felt right (which at least in my eyes was right), it really hurts me to see that even after such a good move, people at least on Twitter still criticise him. I hope that they are mostly bhakts but what bothers me is that seeing the comments it really feels like this country has no hope. Modi has truly built a brand out of himself and there is a sizeable chunk of this country which blindly follows him - raving out about his achievements, making arguments for him just on the basis of whataboutism and obviously not taking any criticism for him like a true narcissist.

As much as I hate this man to the core, this man has successfully used the very fabric of this country - our diversity in culture - and truly gave it a spin of his own and blinded everyone - and the problem is that not only does the boomer generation make up a sizeable chunk of his  disgusting bhakts but it is also the younger generation. He truly used every power in his arsenal - media, politics, businessmen, every damn thing. I don't know but doing something like what Kejriwal did today and still get abused and criticised like trash doesn't instill hope in me for the coming future of this country. I know this may come across as a very pessimistic comment but it is what it is. I really do hope though and wish that somehow things turn around by some miracle and we don't get another BJP ruled country at least in the next election."

India is doomed. I've been arguing against this very fact for years but I feel so helpless against this tide of uninformed opinions and pseudo-nationalism. We really didn't need MMS to tell us that it would be a bad idea to hand out absolute power to someone who supervised a genocide. If majority of us still vote for Modi, we are doomed.


P.S. I urge you to register as a voter and Vote in all elections where you are eligible.

Edit: NOTA was designed to make your voice louder and to make your vote null. Sadly in our country raising voice does not matter at all. Do not vote for NOTA, its not effective. Instead of voting for the current party vote for the opposition party and give them a chance. I do not want Ache din. Give back my good old bure din. That was better We should have listened to him Mass murderer running the country. Sardar ji was always right 

However hate paddlers voted to power and results are there to be seen in every hospital. I remember quite well during 2014 election and visiting sub that people were blaming Muslims and christians for all their problems. They were saying that hindus were living in fear in their own country and basically everything was fault of these two communities. I have seen this sub of course change but i hope those people have learned their lesson that time and time again the right has used fear tactics blaming minorities to win elections. It has never worked out and never will. I often wonder, How did we end up here!! I don't understand how he gets away with blunder after blunder . We listened to the fake news and nationalistic narrative he built around Pulwama. We are so stupid choosing narendra. He is a cheap man craving for power and position. He would go to any extent to keep what he has. The whole mainstream media is under his control. God save this country from this monster and monstrous ideology."
hogueu,,UP gangster Vikas Dubey killed while being taken to Kanpur after arrest yesterday,Politics," Funny thing is everyone knows it was planned. The sheer suddenness of the move! The unexpected nature of the move! The unpredictability of the move! Bizarre, screenwriter of this play must be put in jail for obvious 'reasons' 😝😝 He got Epsteined Car Flipped...Convict tries to steal guns from cops....seems like a typical Hindi movie plot. This is so random.

1. Guy escapes two raids. Atleast one with evidence of prior warning from cops.

2. Goes to a different state and surrenders in a public space.

3. Is seem travelling in a safari at previous toll booths. Different car from the one he escaped.

4. Entire Media convoy following him, is stopped minutes before the encounter for a COVID check, so that's the only part of the journey that is not on camera ?

5. Switches to a TUV, which then turns turtle on a straight road, and without too much visible damage - heck electrics and wipers seen working.

6. A person with a weak leg( has metal rods in it), and obvious paunch, somehow grabs a gun, escapes, climbs a fence, and is then shot?? 

I mean there are so many inconsistencies. Like they don't even care.

 And then there are questions as to his political connections and who stands to gain from his death. I mean if he was with the opposition then, why was he not put on trial and interrogated. I am sure they could have  made him  sing like a Canary to expose the police and politicians involved. At the very least an opportunity missed. [deleted] For all over the world, movies take inspiration from crime scene.

But in rare vice-versa case, UP Cops take inspiration from a Rohit Shetty movie, to fake their encounter. Judge , Jury and Executioner .. Our police does multitask. Unexpectedly expected, political masters turning the tables.

Can anyone tell me why he had to shoot those 8 policemen knowing he had no way out ? Jeep turned over of course. He got out unhurt and tried to escape, of course. He got shot, dead, of course.

He wasn’t even in that jeep as per cctv cameras. Of course."

Modi is a coward and a psychopath!

https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/676627652204060672 [removed] It’s not Modiji’s fault, it’s just people are breathing too much oxygen. Sit back and relax, we have beaten COVID-19 long back. It is simple when you have to decide fight or flight situation our PM choose flight easiest way out, he has a lot of paid and unpaid buffoons in his hand chosen ministers and arms of blind bhakts, bhakts to defend him and his actions and thoughts, he doesn't have to worry as of now. Either he is very confident of wining election and he doesn't care or he is knows that he won't win elections that's why he doesn't care. His friends are safe, so why bother about common man, he and his party people have put poison in people's mind which is enough for a generation. Forget about being quiet.. atleast he should do what a PM is expected to do in such scenerio. Instead he is doing something which an ape wouldn't even think of doing. He built a wall to hide slums, now he is trying to show the world that every thing is fine and we are spending crores and crores on a redundant development. If you tell a Gow-Rakshak, that he is a Cow-Ward he will be happy! He is a big fucking coward and honestly I still can't believe he is TAKING COMPLAINTS DOWN FROM TWITTER, Yogi Adityanath literally made it ILLEGAL  to complain about shorting of oxygen cylinders and meds. Like bro what? We are not blind and the world is not blind. I am so sure he's not going to win in 2024 and I hope he just looses unless the corrupt system helps Modi buy votes. 

Also he blamed Muslims for spreading COVID? WTF actual fuck? He did it. He allowed all the Rallies, He allowed the dumb ass Kumbh Mela. Was Kumbh  and Election rallies so important? 

What happened to the money donated to the ""PM Care funds"" ? I don't see any outcome when we are lacking basic supplies even. Doctors literally choose who lives and dies and this shouldn't have happened. This was avoidable but HE CHOSE THIS. Now he's going to get aid from other countries and put PM Case fund label on it.

gv18m3,"When I was a kid, it was commonplace to see those fairness cream ads which didn’t even make me think twice about the underlying idea that was being propagated that fair skin is preferable to darker skin. It is only when I grew older that I started to realise the racist ideology behind it. It is ingrained from a young age that being fair is better. I wonder, how many dark skinned actresses  do we have in comparison to fair actresses ? I have also seen people going for arranged marriages having their first preference as ‘fair’. Moreover, I always noticed that people had this sense of unusual inferiority ( or unnecessary over the top respect) when a white person would, for example, come to their schools or make a visit. 
And just one more thing - it’s time we stopped encouraging our celebrities who are merely people who act in movies to give their opinion on everything. Who the fuck cares? They act - great, and we enjoy watching them - but we don’t need their opinion on every single issue. And please stop propagating your opinion on the black lives matter movement when you yourself were promoting fairness cream products.
We as a country ( and across the world, for that matter) value beauty and entertainment  more than brains and education.",The very fact that we have fairness creams and celebrities promoting them is a racist ideology that needs to be crushed.,Non-Political," The fact that Fair&Lovely survived this long shows how ignorant we are. I am a Tamilian raised in Bombay so I’ve watched Tamil and Hindi films. I’ve noticed that there is not one dark skinned actress. At least mainstream to slightly below mainstream. All very fair to wheatish skin tones. 

Also, in Tamil movies, there are a lot of North Indian actresses that dominate the box office. Because North Indians are fairer than South Indians (I’m generalising but still).  It’s insane. I have yet to see one single dark skinned actress (there are some dark skinned actors and that’s a sexism issue for another discussion anyway) even though majority of South Indians have dark skin. It baffles me. 

Even crazier is how the main heroine or the love interest of the film is always super fair but the friends she is surrounded by or is interacting with are the usual Tamil looking, kind of darker skinned women. And the hero notices her from the distance.

Something to think about, really. [deleted] the same thing applies in movies were the vast majority of villains are dark skinned. quite prominent down here in the south. Indians live under self imposed racism. I always see people with dark color use these creams. These ads have given them a complex and I hate that. I always advice my friends and families to not use those things It is not just businesses. They just exploit the prevalent public sentiments.

This mess goes deeper than we realise.

""Radha kyun gori, mein kyun kaala"".

""Hai raam, isse kaun shaadi karega"" ... and so on My grandma is a 68 years old Kumaoni woman with a dark complexion while my grand father is very light skinned. They had a love marriage back in the day but she was despised so much by her in laws and othe relatives due to her dark skin that she still has an obsession with using fair and lovely and other fairness treatments. It's sad and goes to show how deeply skin colour based discrimination is embedded in to our society. I mean, our mainstream media openly advertises products that will help you become fairer and thus ""more beautiful"".
Might be an unpopular opinion but that's a really shitty thing and goes on to show how far down we haven tumbled as a society.

They are hell bent on using Ayurvedic medicine first. Even after i have been saved from life endangering sickness, twice, by allopathic medicines. Scientific and logically speaking ayurved does not hold much but personally i believe Ayurved is a treatment system for the gone ages. The times when Ayurved was developed, they didn't have paracetamol or crocins for fever, nor eno for 6 second aaram. Now we do have them.

Personally i feel Ayurved helped make what modern medicine is today, as others have mentioned that some Ayurvedic principles are adopted into allopathy as well. Great! Ayurveda just evolved and became Allopathy. people decided to stick to the old practices because pehle aise hi hota tha. Sorry lekin pehle gas ki problem thik karne pura din lagta tha abi eno piyo kaam pe niklo.
Rant over. Wow! It is telling all about coronil tablet that its only immunity booster not a vaccine Patanjali is the shitiest brand there is... Nil Coro! What an absolute clown - he’s doing more harm than good to India and Indians! Just another profit monger who doesn’t really care about anyone’s life or death. The trick is simple.

70-80% people recover from the disease just by isolating+exercise+healthy diet. In that case anyone can make a placebo medicine, make patients have that and eventually people will recover on their own. Then claim that your medicine has a success rate of 80% or maybe 100%.

But that is not the ""treatment"". 

The challenge is, how will explain all this to blind followers (many of them being well educated), and people who don't even have minimum levels of reasoning/understanding. Conclusion: any publicity is good publicity. personally always in favor of ayurvedic/herbal medicines, but always appalled at the way Patanjali brings in the stuff to market. Total disregard of safety, rules and regulations, just to earn. this is like playing with human lives. Hell even in software industry they 'test-test-test' before bringing anything to market"

Even more baffling is ZERO outrage over lack of transperancy, where is this country heading? Don't tell me that Vijay didn't know what the PMcares was for, when he dumped his money.

BJP bought MLAs, did big rallies, paid off EC etc etc. The money is all gone now. It's insane that after paying tax on your income, savings and expenditure, people still donate to the government when they come to you shamelessly with a begging bowl. Better off spending that money elsewhere like donating to NGOs which actually do good work or independent media organizations like Caravan/NL/Wire. Every one saying that it doesn't guarantee  a hospital bed should internalize the fact why the PM CARES Fund was supposedly instituted in the first place. He's disappointed that no extra preparation had been done by the govt to combat the fallout of covid.

i424wk,,Congress and Ayodhya,Politics," [removed] I don't understand. Wouldn't this be counterproductive to the Congress party?
 
1. They're not going to pull the fanatic vote from the BJP. Never going to happen in a million years.
2. They lose the confidence and support of the minorities
3. They sow more infighting within their own ranks (as if it wasn't bad enough already)

At this rate, won't be long before this national party holds less seats than regional ones lmao. Honestly Congress has no stand. Stick to one thing guys. Shameless party .Responsible for the mess this country is in today Well not just Priyanka Gandhi or Kamalnath, its their official stand as a party.

This is the reason Congress will never get the respect of people. They might have good politicians but they have no ideology or a vision for India. This appeasement may or may not benefit them politically, I don't know. But they will never have anyone's respect. 

This is the sole reason BJP has been successful, because people align with their ideologies. Whether we think the ideology is right or wrong. So accurate! This spineless airheaded opposition is what has doomed our country.

Congress was a major major player in Babri Masjid case, so it's obvious they can do all sorts of drama to win over people and that's their ideology, though BJP too belongs to that ideology and takes it to next level. Congressis will masquerade as liberals and we'll have to be wary about that. One of the lowest moments of INC. [deleted]"

jv14ds,,Mumbai witnessed lowest noise pollution in 15 years during Diwali: NGO,Non-Political,"  Mumbai recorded the lowest level of noise pollution in the last 15 years on the first day of Diwali festival on Saturday during the permissible hours when the use of firecrackers was allowed, according to an NGO. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had banned firecracker and fireworks in the city in a bid to check the spread of coronavirus.

*Summary generated by [sansa](https://sansa.news/c/?i=d309c6)* r/UpliftingNews Wait till Kangana Ranaut comes back. Congratulations to everyone who chose not to burst crackers. You are absolutely gorgeous human beings. Please keep the spirit and refrain from bursting crackers even during the new year. 

Way to go, Mumbai! :) As someone who's stayed here since  ages was shocked nd proud at how Mumbaikars responded .That's what makes this city so great ,  everybody chipped in nd thankfully for the right cause . Arnab is back now Yeah nobody in my society was bursting crackers this time around.

Just some rich assholes from another society were bursting along with triggering nearby car alarms. Aside from bursting crackers, I think us Indians have a habit of honking unnecessarily on roads. It would be great if we can reduce that as well which will further reduce the sound pollution. I agree! This year even the pollution levels were down. I could see the beautiful lightings on all the buildings. Usually it gets blocked by smoke. That's good. Now if we all could focus on the root cause of pollution that happens all year and act upon it, that would be amazing. To all those posting on Facebook that bursting crackers is promoting anti-Hindu sentiments, crackers  never had any meaning in Hinduism or Hindu mythologies. Go light Diyas. That is how they had welcome Lord Ram, not by firing rockets in the sky. Stop creating  unnecessary religious hatred. All they do is portray Hinduism in wrong sense."

President of India 25 July 2012 – 25 July 2017. > **Last volume of his autobiography, Pranab Mukherjee had decreed, should be published only after his death,** raising the possibility of a tell-all book covering the eventful period between 2004 and 2020.

> He got along famously with Indira Gandhi when she returned to power in 1980. Indira Gandhi gave him the big assignment of handling the economy as her Finance Minister. It was the period when Pranab da learnt the art of managing power, developing contacts both in the world of business and commerce as well as in politics. Dhiru Bhai Ambani among many other big names in the Bombay industrial world befriended him and he soon began to be seen as their man in Delhi. They were just a phone call away.

> Pranab da was known as a trouble shooter within the Congress Party, a job he began to do for Narasimha Rao in the early 1990s when Rao felt threatened from his colleagues Arjun Singh and Sharad Pawar.

> After aspiring to be the Prime Minister and having burnt his fingers in the process earlier, he was content to be number two in the power hierarchy. It was a job he did with such finesse that every Congress Prime Minister loved to keep him as his number two. When Manmohan Singh took office as Prime Minister in 2004, he leaned heavily on Mukherjee who served him as his master trouble shooter all through a decade between 2004-12. Even Congress President Sonia Gandhi took his counsel in party matters.

> Mischievous newsmen would try to provoke him by telling him that he deserved to be the Prime Minister since Dr Manmohan Singh was the RBI Governor when he was the Finance Minister. But Mukherjee would deftly fend off the bouncers by declaring that since he did not speak Hind well, he could never be the PM. One could never be sure if he really meant it.

> All those who came in close contact with Pranab da understood that he wished to be the Prime Minister of the country when Manmohan Singh pipped him to the post. I once bluntly asked him: “Dada, I expected you to be the Prime Minister in 2004; what went wrong.” He looked at me, smiled, shrugged off his shoulders and just uttered a word: “Destiny”.

[Pranab Mukherjee(1935-2020): He was a copybook President who played with a straight bat](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/obituary/pranab-mukherjee1935-2020-he-was-a-copybook-president-who-played-with-a-straight-bat). He received Padma Vibhushan in 2008 and Bharat Ratna in 2019 This must be the biggest loss in India due to Covid19. Probably one of the most high profile casualty in the world? 

He contacted the virus on his several trips to hospital for a separate procedure. Rest in peace Sir. Damn. What a bad year 2020 is turning into. RIP. Well obviously RIP but I think it's stupid to say he was a huge contribution to Indian politics. He was a part of the Congress inner clan and got his positions only due to Gandhi family loyalty. When made defense and finance ministers during UPA, he screwed up both and made some terrible decisions. I don't know why that is being whitewashed now Hearing -23.9%? RIP. We bengalese have special respect for him as a celebrity (ex President of India) not as a politician. Don't want to be that guy.

kq0fk7,,"‘No video of Munawar Faruqui insulting Hindu deities,’ say police two days after arresting him",Politics," [deleted] Social media pressure works. I hope such outrages happen every time an innocent is troubled. The law has become a joke, why arrest when you don't have the evidence for what he did. What a shameful police, first they will arrest and then start finding the evidence for the crime which he hasn't committed. The police is making a complete mockery of the law system. All Bhakts who were ranting since yesterday: *Surprised pikachu face *

\- Andh Bhakt tldr; The Indore Police on Sunday said they had no video evidence to show that comedian Munawar Faruqui insulted Hindu deities during a performance at a cafe in the city. The complaint was filed by Eklavya Singh Gaur, the chief of Hindutva group Hind Raksh

*Summary generated by [sansa](https://sansa.news/)* Hopefully in some 10-20 years they’ll be able to find something.

There's a big Infighting between Vijayvargiya and Gaur/Mahajan in Indore. They use Vijayvargiya as a ground support and used Gaur/Mahajan as face but recently to please Vijayvargiya they are giving him more Importance also her son has literally zero ground support and completely overshadowed by Vijayvargiya sons who has a 20k members in his specific fringe group.

I am positively hoping that most of our public will be exposed to such content and will criticize OTT regulation. But I don't know may be I am hoping too much. SD quality only. Meh. They are runninga a stress test. They will be prepared. Most of them pirate the shows/movies. So most people just want to experience the app I  think.

jh4fa8,,How to get married in India: Interfaith couple edition,Politics," Fuck, man--my BP just shot through the roof after reading that... and here I thought that all I'd have to do was stand before a judge, sign a paper and poof: I'm Married.

Thanks a lot for destroying my fantasy, mate! (; I did inter-religion marriage, thankfully both our families have full support First wait till the girl is 18-25 and the boy is 21-28 depending on the trend in your locality. Then make a profile in the matrimonial site. 

Preferences depends on - 1)age(boy should be older)  2) skin colour 3) religion 4)caste 5) horoscope 
And then 6) education 7)job 8)family 9)issues in the family 10)if the girl and the boy are not okay, tell them to deal with it 11) decide the date and day 12)if there's something wrong in the horoscope, perform gazillion number of rituals to make the planets and stars go to the position they should be in. Go to Kerala, or West Bengal. Get married. Then move to Bangalore or Mumbai. Damn interfaith is so faraway my parents are against intercaste as well! I got married in 2012 under the SMA. A couple of things to clear up:

Families DO NOT need to be notified. If this is happening, then it's some marriage officers being over-zealous. The officer is only required to put up a public notice at the marriage office.

The objections that can be raised are very specific and deal with the age of the parties, whether they are of sound mind, whether they are in a prohibited relationship (various degrees of incest) and so on. You can't just object to the marriage, you have to give one of these reasons. Only then is the marriage officer supposed to make enquiries to verify these objections.

EDIT: We had to visit the office a total of two times, once to submit documents for the notice and once for the actual marriage. The marriage is done in a matter of minutes, verify details for the certificate, then you stand up and read the oath each, signatures from your witnesses (3) and the officer and you're done. Why tf does what your family say have any role in marriage between adults. As someone who's best option is an interfaith marriage, this would be depressing if I wanted to get married. Why though? Why can't 2 consenting adults just get married without having to get ""permission"" from their family? Well that depends on the combo. A lot of foreigners get married to their Indian spouse (many women) via SMA but it's not a clear cut process. If the male is a Muslim or non-White foreigner, expect a lot of roadblocks in the process. 

This British era acts need to be completely revamped. I was born in a muslim family(I'm an atheist) and my bf, Sikh family. We thought the only problem would be the paperwork and the after party for friends and family. Didn't know families had to consent. My family may not agree though they said they are ok after seeking ""swamijis"". Yes.. my muslim mother seeks swamijis.. all that is ok but marriage? ""Apne community mein hi honi chahiye"" because ""you just want to hurt me. Log kya kahenge"" 

I think the best way to go is never get married. We aren't too sure about children anyway... it's just that we want to apply for joint home loan when the time comes."

Please.",Time to get Face to Face with WhiteHatJr and BYJUS.,Non-Political," Wolf Gupta reminds me of that DiCaprio film where he portrays Jordan Belfort. well sadly am neither on linkedin, nor on twitter... so i think I'm just gonna upvote and comment for visibility. Look at this. [https://twitter.com/neeleshmisra/status/1313325581149196290](https://twitter.com/neeleshmisra/status/1313325581149196290) I support Dr. Aniruddha Malpani and Pradeep Poonia Firat of all this wold gupta kid is fucking fake i have searched everywhere and there is no mention of anyone getting such job in Google .
And even it was real then he is in the top percentile of the population not every kid is same , comparing him to others just adds more pressure on the kids i dont think 9 yr old need to learn abt programming this early ,how can parents fall for such shit. These scumbags  are everywhere. I even saw them on sky sports UK and international channel. Certainly they have too much and too much power. So more power to you. I salute your persistence bro!! It's pretty stupid to force 9yr olds to learn coding. They will have a hard time understanding it unless they are a prodigy. But a prodigy doesn't need any shitty online tutorials to learn, they can do it by themselves. So these companies serve zero purpose and are pure scams. Retweeted if it counts for anything. Keep it up bro! You're doing the right thing, keep your head up high. Hope they don't stress you out further though, and just shut shop or become responsible. Tweet or DM to Neelesh Mishra(the RJ).He tweeted regarding whitehat jr today.If you can get his RT then you can get amplified.

mng0rj,"I didn't find a relevant subreddit to post this, so here I am.

Long read.


We put a house for rent, on Magic Bricks. It was not being occupied for over 3 months since we put it there. 

Today morning we received a call from a man, speaking in Hindi, and that he wanted the house. He said he was a government employee. He said that he was being transferred from Guwahati to Hyderabad, and that his work starts here on 15th. He said he was coming with his family. He didn't care how the house looked and wanted to shift right away. He was ready for payment. Shifting right away should've been the first hint for my dad to stop this thing.

We were happy he talked with my dad. We asked for a two month advance on the property. He accepted. We sent the contract and he agreed. My dad's generally a stickler for details. The contract was 7 pages long. My dad's the kind of guy who when we bought a different house, he sent 160 cracks in the tiles of the house and got them all repaired. He once made Godrej replace an entire refrigerator, as it was making noise. It was OUT of warranty, he did that over freaking written post letters.

My dad asked him for his aadhar, PAN and ID card. He sent all of them, over WhatsApp. He sent a CRPF ID Card. It is either stolen or fake. The name on them was Ram Vilas Yadav Singh.

His scheme works like this, he requests money from you. A classic. To gain trust, he first requests for ₹1 over PayTM. He tried to convince us that accepting the request, that is clicking the ""pay"" option over PayTM will credit money. My dad trying to disprove him, he clicks on pay, since it was only ₹1. He sent back ₹2, which my dad didn't see. He told us to check the balance, and the balance increased by ₹1. 

Then he eventually requests ₹28,000, in various installments. ₹4,999*3+ ₹10,000+₹3,000. Can't belive my Dad fell for this 5 times in this same call. 

Our language is not natively Hindi, so there was that, but my dad could speak decently. Caller was also telling to it fast, as his boss was pushing him. Under these conditions my dad succumbed to give the money. Goddammit. It was gone.

My dad had checked his bank statement. Deducted. With names like CcAvenue. And Ram Vilas and some other stuff.


We tried to talk to him again, he lifted. We asked for your money. He said he was sending it, he again tries the same thing. Luckily now my dad didn't fall again


Afterwards like 5 minutes later, we call him, he says he was in a bank, and would transfer it. We asked which bank he cut the call. 

I am sure we won't get the money back. My dad called out bank and is explaining the situation as if we didn't accept the transactions. It was suggested by my dad's friend who was well settled in a high position in the same bank.

I told the whole situation to my dad, he understood how he was scammed. My dad will probably register a police complaint. The person deleted all the IDs he sent over WhatsApp. 

Lol it was my dad's fault all along. This post is to raise awareness for future potential buyers, sellers, agents, tenants and renters. 


Put the flair as Non-Political and didn't find a relevant one. Maybe in the future we could have an ""awareness"" flair.

Edit:

Guess what my dad's a software engineer lmao


Edit 2:

Apparently the CCAvenue he used wasn't the real one. He used ""CCAvenues"" (with the s) are merchant name. You can keep anything as merchant name. According to a few sources, these people buy used offline accounts from newly graduated etc people. They use a procedure to make it online, and keep such names. So therefore I can't complain to the real CCAvenue.",Today I'll tell you people how my dad gave away ₹28k to an stranger over a call,Non-Political," Hey!
You mentioned your statement shows CCAvenue. Please reach out to them ASAP. Explain this with your bank statement of the debit and the whole scam. There is a good chance that you might be able to recover it.
Your case is slightly better because there is a payment gateway involved and not directly to the person. Such cases are on the rise and scammers are wreaking havoc. Just a few days ago someone made a post here. They were scammed using this same procedure.  

You should lodge a complaint with cyber police as well. Give them all the ID proof details and phone number you have.  

Edit: here's the post   https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/mgsmuy/fellow_indians_i_have_just_been_scammed_in_olx/ Yeah. Thats why I advice my dad and other elderly folk to not use UPI or related apps. The risks far outweigh the convenience and they’re pretty much couple of social engineering calls away from losing 1000s in savings How on earth did we end up in the situation where there are a bunch of proof's required for opening a bank account, doing KYC,etc. But the same KYC cannot be used to catch people running such frauds. There is more than enough data to find the culprit, just no will, or collusion against it My dad also lost 21k over call from scamster, my dad is also alike your dad very detailed oriented person, but at that moment he just followed the instructions given over call as some hypnotized person. I always tell my dad that he should never enter his pin in google pay unless he is the one who is sending money. If anyone tells him that he needs to enter pin to receive money, I ask him to use any abusive or filthy word which comes to his mind. There are many similar scams going on mainly in Rental and used markets.

Since your dad is very details orientated, other person might at least be a 10% of it.

Hope he learnt a expensive lesson and will not trust unknown person again. I got 3 types of scam calls, immediately identified, disconnected them and didn't lose any money.

First was that I won Tata Innova car for shopping on Flipkart

Second was I complained on failed BSNL recharge on Twitter, some fake BSNL employee called me and asked to forward activation SMS to another number.

Third was some insurance policy which matured, but didn't claim money. The issue is I don't have any insurance policy!

Scammers try different tactics all the time. It's difficult to avoid them. Also, financial literacy and how to avoid scams must be taught in school syllabus, but there's [no such subject](http://cart.ebalbharati.in/BalBooks/ebook.aspx). There's [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/InsuranceAngels) where people have lost money.

Once again, I think financial literacy must be taught in say 9^th to 12^th standard. I lost 3500 rupees this way. I have a similar story. 
I have a friend who got a from a scammer saying he won a lottery of 16lakhs rupees. And he just needs to pay 8k rupees in bank transfer. And got scammed. Happened two years ago. 

But we thought he would learn from that. Didn't. Not even 2 months after got a text from a random number, was a girl from Delhi. They talked back and forth exchanged pictures. She asked to borrow 10k said she would return it in 3 weeks. He did and got blocked. 

We still do roast sessions every month about both the times. Well. Welcome to the club."

They are trying to incite the farmers to take action and once the farmers do that they will turn the whole narrative on its head and say that it was the farmers who started throwing stones. 

These videos will also be gradually removed from the internet and soon everyone will forget about all this and move on. BJP will win a few more states meanwhile and everyone will blame the opposition for it (I mean, they are to be blamed but the people are also to be blamed for forgetting all this and being gullible as fuck).

I live in Bengal and trust me, if you don't want to specifically know about covid news you won't even get a whiff of what is happening out there. The news papers, TV channels are so focussed on the election that no one cares anymore that we are calling our own doom. If anyone we know tests positive for COVID people just shrug and say, ""Whats the use of lockdown if we still get the disease anyway"" (we've been business as usual since last October). Talk about politics though and people will defend their opinions like they are getting personally paid by the ministers. The kumbh and these rallies are gonna have a dire effect..

Any news on if anyone filed petition or is it ""Kanoon andha hai"" literally? Modi disgusts me,

he's out there campaigning in bengal while the country is spiking. It's such a WTF moment.

*Mera Bharat is, indeed, Mahan.* You know I bow down to Amit Shah. Dude has successfully instilled a robot at the seat of PM and does whatever he wants while Modi takes the heat for it. Really is the chanakya of Indian politics. What is sad is that there is still a very large majority that blindly supports him. They still argue that if he doesn't do this then Bengal and Hindutva will be destroyed. So, in their head Modiji is doing all this for the larger good. Like everything else so far. 

If only there was a true opposition and little bit spine left with media. This idiot only understands the language of eyeballs and PR – and if media decided to show the right thing one morning I bet he will fall back in line to some level (or go batshit nitrous-boost on his fascist pedal).

Do the Sikh characters in these movies speak Telegu too ? Most Telugu movies are so funny to watch even the serious scenes 😂 Toxic masculinity, massive hero-worshipping, dark-skin shaming and now hyper-patriotism, that pretty much sums up mainstream action Telugu movies with big heroes and big budget. For sensible movies, one has to stick with underdog movie makers. These guys better not use mobile phones in another attire. MB about to commit Human Rights violation.

jzc2hc,,Delhi HC starts hearing Karan Bajaj's defamation matter against Pradeep Poonia. [Live Updates],Business/Finance," > Rao states that so far as psychological abuse of kids by WhiteHat Jr is concerned, it's infact the parents place to decide.  

https://twitter.com/LiveLawIndia/status/1330769047286206464 

This is unfortunately the crux of the matter. Poonia is up against the Indian parental society as a whole. Whitehat is just the face the problem. and now the appeal to authority:  Rao: The person who invested $300 million in us in a not a fool.   
 https://twitter.com/LiveLawIndia/status/1330765395360268293?s=20 

not surprised they paid this card. Sukumar should retaliate with the stories of IIPM and Theranos! Is this Rohatgi on Bajaj's side Mukul Rohatgi? That former Attorney General of India?  
If yes, then WhiteHat Jr is spending A LOT on this case!! Bajaj says Poonia has hacked his password lmao  Rao states that while Poonia may not be making money, he is using WhiteHat Jr's content.  ""When you're out to be a crusader, please remember that your freedom ends where my nose begins.""   


ooh.. what content is Poonia exactly using? the phrase Whitehat? The High Court's questions should absolutely terrify every sane individual. I get asking questions about false claims of pornography, but for them to claim that a person can't even make a disparaging comment about educators is utterly bizarre.  They're literally demanding Poonia produce evidence in the form of lists of WhiteHat instructors. All of this on the basis of clearly hyperbolic criticism aimed at the organization arguing that they obviously don't employ trained instructors.

For them to start prejudging matters by offering a preliminary injunction to WhiteHat and also making comments saying even derogatory commentary is defamatory is basically saying there's no such thing as free speech.

Defamation is not just impolite speech. It only applies to demonstrably false speech. The burden of proof should be on WhiteHat to show that Poonia's facts are incontestably false. Instead all they're offering are bleats about their reputation and saying parents should choose (as if poonia has said otherwise) and the court is going along with it. Fingers crossed... even if am aware of the country’s state... 😟

At least silent media start covering these... given HC case and all?

I already miss him so much. I lived away from my father because of my studies but I was never afraid of anything because I always knew no matter what happens my father is there for me and no matter the problem he will come through for me.

The whole [news about ASCI taking down WhiteHatJr](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/special/exclusive-advertising-body-asks-whitehat-jr-to-pull-down-ads/63767/1) was to mellow down resentment against WhiteHatJr and give them a fresh clean slate. Their actions of giving WhiteHatJr an easy escape in case of false advertisement is getting more suspicious. They didn't respond on

1. Why only 5 ads were objected
2. What about the rest 100s of false ads
3. Didn't show the email threads regarding their complaint to WhitehatJr.
4. Didn't tell if they asked who is Wolf Gupta.

ASCI is not a govt body, as it might sound. It's a self-regulation body run by corporates themselves. So kind of their own front to give themselves clean chit when in trouble.

* Karan Bajaj does a post last evening (4th Nov 2020) around 6pm-ish and calls us a 'Troll' . He wrote ""*A troll works hard too but to tear things down to gain fame, followers, and perhaps fortune. Destroying value and lives in the process.*""
* I didn't respond to his BS. Although at once I got very angry I decided to not play by their rules and keep my focus on more solid proofs. Finally, I didn't comment or anything under his post. For many people who did, their comments got deleted.
* My LinkedIn account gets banned at midnight, around 6 hours after Karan Bajaj calling me a troll.

Now.

1. Karan Calling us a troll: Have you ever seen a CEO acting like this? He also said I am doing this for 'fortune'. So the one who is making $300 million for scamming gullible kids is doubting my intentions. Apart from losing 11 kg in 2.5 months and gaining 27k Karma on Reddit, I am not making a dime here. You guys know my intentions. If anyone still doubts, go to my Reddit posts, scroll down, go to the first posts and see I was posting against Crypto scams as well 3 years back.
2. First, they banned my videos on YT, Quora account, Twitter Id, LinkedIn posts, Panzy Saran tried putting false allegations of harassment on me, and finally, my LinkedIn account goes down. And YET I am a troll and Karan Bajaj is a saint for looting innocent Indian parents.
3. I tried to not make this public because some of my family and friends are also watching this thing getting unfold, I didn't want them to worry. But it's high time I must talk about the msgs I get in DMs.  Ex and current Byjus employees tell me that I must be worried about my physical safety all the time now. A journalist and a good friend told me I am being watched. And even my phone number might be getting tapped. One other journalist told me that I must prepare a dead man switch.

[Such msgs are regular these days. And hence I am living in a safe place alone.](https://preview.redd.it/x4kglhj24fx51.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d21192c868b8637d98a7bdbfda5f00f1adcee2b7)

4.  One of WhiteHatJr employee (the ones who makes fake profiles all the time on Twitter and tries to do fake +ve reinforcement under my tweets) crossed all the limits. He dared to abuse my mother. And I know these scums would be lurking around this post as well, so listen carefully, I will find out who you are and will make you apologize.

[I will SSLY make you apologize.](https://preview.redd.it/4iyl6cuvefx51.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97714a0ab82b1b281d6c8ab1a6c0058aff66c317)

&#x200B;

5. I am still working on the list I talked about last time. I will try to find out every single post/video/tweet/article that was taken down by them and then try to get every single on them reinstated.

6. I have updated most of the journalists in my contact about the potential danger to my life, but seems like it's trivial for them. They are waiting for something to happen. Live Mint recently was doing an article on the WhiteHatJr issue and I was working with one of their good journalist Salman. But in the last hours, the article got canned. This has happened with 4 other publications already in the last 30 days.

&#x200B;

Now this time it's time for YOU to **ACT**. You guys do something, write a post on LinkedIn, ask Karan Bajaj why my ID was banned, why his people are falling down to such low levels and abusing my mother, why isn't he answering any single questions.

The ENTIRE tech community is on our side, how come we don't have a say in how coding must be taught to kids. On one side there is the experience of lakhs of years of coding and engineering and on the other side there are a bunch of greedy VCs who wants to make a circus out of our entire educations system, putting lakhs of kids into the danger of life long depressions, and lakhs of parents into EMI traps.

I have been trying my best on all platforms, from one platform they make me run to another one and then to the third one. It's time to put a stop to this. Even after a couple of good articles from The Ken, Morning Context, Forbes are still daring to call us trolls and putting a ban on us. Let's make an example of this scam so that other 'EdTechs' never forget to stay within ethical limits.

## United we stand, divided we fall

Please ACT. Tweet, Write on LinkedIn, Medium, Quora, FB, IG, Reddit whatever. But in the comments, this time, let's talk about your contribution to this cause.

&#x200B;

Thank you

Big fan of your courage sir. This is the real life David Vs Goliath show. Full support to you. OP is gonna single handedly take down white hat Jr. Apparently Facebook has invested in Byju's too?

Probably most of the online platforms in which you are trying to raise your voice has a stake in Byju's. I think it will be easy for them to control the narrative online and suppress any dissent. 

I know WHJr is ethically wrong but have you across anything that is against the law? Can we build a legal case against them? I think only involving the courts and the government could put an end to their malpractices. If any lawyer or legal professional is reading this please comment on what's the best way to move forward.

Stay safe and stay strong! Have been following your posts and videos since your first post. You are a real life hero. Respect. Done my part,  more power to you Is any lawyer working with you? I don't see serious action coming from facebook/linkedin etc without a some group with political backing coming together.

I think you should ensure that you have a copy of the ads, backup them on web archiver. I think a lawyer is the only way to get any action. 

> putting lakhs of kids into the danger of life long depressions, and lakhs of parents into EMI traps.

This isn't limited to WhitehatJr. Byju's the parent company has been doing it for a long time and hasn't seen any legal action. 


You are fighting an important battle, but I am not sure depending on linkedin/facebook/twitter or news channel is going to be right strategy. I was sceptical about you at first but learnt soon about your good intentions.

Jeez man, that's a lot to handle, hope you have people around you, take care of yourself.

I thought things were going good after you got your accounts from YouTube etc. 

Isn't spying on people by corporate illegal? 

That dead man switch is a good idea may be get some help from a cyber security consultant. As you are from Cisco someone can help you out maybe from IT side. Set up a auto email or something.

As they are giving you threats don't take it light this is India anything can happen, be safe man. [removed] The influence these people have over social media to silence their critics is scary af."

Jayalalithaa entered the film industry at a very young age and while that allowed her to work on over 100 films during her  career, it also had its downside. For instance, when she worked in her first Tamil film Vennira Aadai in 1965, she was still a teenager. The film made history because it got an A rating, meaning only adults could watch it. Unfortunately, for 17-year-old Jaya, this meant that she couldn’t watch her performance in her debut project.

Vennira Aadai earned its A-rating after it featured Jayalalithaa in a song sequence where she was bathing in a waterfall in a sleeveless blouse. But looks like even the A-rating couldn’t keep Jayalalithaa from becoming a star as Vennira Aadai went on to become a hit, running in theaters for over 100 days. Her turn as Shobha in the romantic film won her praise and got her a strong fan base overnight, according to a report in Jansatta. Watch her interview with Simi Garewal. You will see a different side of her. [deleted] TBH....this censorship needs to go. Just rate the movie, don't ask the filmmaker to cut scenes out. It should be a certification board, not censorship.

What is privilege motion?

> A privileged motion is a motion **that is granted precedence over ordinary business because it concerns matters of great importance or urgency.** 

So much was the urgency that her statement was discussed and given importance, over other ""ordinary issues"", that too in a pandemic. Remember guys, nobody is a winner in this, all of us are the real losers. BMC can go fuck itself. Can't fucking contain the virus but has all the time to do these petty shit. They did the same with Kapil Sharma when he spoke out against Modi. Correct me if I am wrong, but MHA guidelines forbid demolitions and razing of buildings (whether legal or illegal) until 30th September under the lockdown guidelines since May. 

How is BMC carrying this out? Do they have no other priorities? Always remember 

If government is harrassing someone for their personal agenda and you don't stand for the harrased, then a time will come when you'll be in that person's shoes and no one will stand for you. Kangna has gone from bollywood survivor to BJP wannabe! I detest her. But this kind of targetting by BMC is pretty disgusting. This further gives this lady and bjp more fuel for their propaganda!

kmc26z,,Centrist,Politics," [removed] I mean, whaT, this is too much of an exaggeration. THat's not a centrist, that's just a douche. This is satire. Centrism doesn't mean supporting moral wrong. Although, the comments there and some here, seem like they have a rage boner against anyone who isn't an absolute communist.

Jesus Christ. One can support socialist policies in education, agriculture and medicine; And support capitalist policies in Land, technology, service and luxury products... And NOT support murder. Only Siths deal in absolutes. That's not centrism. Centrism is about taking a stance after careful evaluation of each issue individually, instead of trying to solve the myriad and radically different complex issues using the same ideology and principles. Centrists are people who understand that a single ideology cannot solve everything.

Centrism is NOT about taking the average of whatever the left and the right say and applying it. It is about realizing and appreciating that issues are extremely complex and different. That post is extremely immature. I strongly suggest that you moderate yourself and get realistic.

And yes, centrists can and usually are just as radically opposed to genocides as the modern left is. [Sometimes it works out for them](https://i.imgur.com/pF82Ujb.png) [deleted] You can simplify anything to such a degree that it losts its original meaning.

I mean I can see the owner's viewpoint, he is not at fault really, petrol pump owners get 3 rupees out of those 100, and that's just the revenue, these guys are franchisees, so there are costs and thr fact that the franchise company gets a share. He didn't threaten him physically, just legally. This is on the people pressuring the owner and not the owner himself. I mean imagine some dude comes to your petrol pump, makes a video and you are not even the subject of it, the government is, and you get threatened from higher ups and lose all your revenue overnight. 

The people pressuring the owner need to be reprimanded The license is provided by centre, owner is right,

Really loved your idea though... Minimalist is love! Lol you chose white color. More so reason for idiots to use it as writing paper. ""Sonam gupta bewafa hain"". No doubt this looks awesome AF.

I won't say India is a democracy untill we have a tight opposition. Good luck winning the 2024 election if things go on as they are going. Seems unnecessary and a tad cringy tbh. Clueless headline.

P.S. That doesn't mean what India did is great either. There is no silver lining in this forced narrative setting. Not being a bhakh here. Everyone knows what modi is like, but are editors allowed to show their biasness in the newspapers like this?

So how can there be a shortage of safety gear in India?"
h04gab,"Read an heart wrenching article yesterday, on the migrants returning back to work in Mumbai, Delhi and other metros from their native places in UP, Bihar, MP.

Despite knowing that these metros are right now hotbed of infection, they have no choice. Instead of being killed due to hunger, they are taking a chance against the virus. Some of them had returned to their native by walking, and crawling, but after receiving one call from their employer, they immediately packed their bags, left their families and on their way to risk and death.

Why?

Are they stupid?

No. They are helpless, and they have no option left.

India, is a nation of massive disparity and inequality in wealth. Did you know that 73% of overall wealth generated in India went to the richest 1% in 2017. In 2018, 2 Indians every second were pushed to poverty due to rising healthcare cost.

Take the wealth of 95 crore Indians, multiple it by 4, and that's the wealth which the richest 1% Indians are controlling right now.

75% of rural India lives on Rs 33 per day.

People sipping Glenfiddich whiskey, and having no tension of food and shelter for the rest of their lives are calling these people stupid and fool who are not able to maintain 'social distancing' for stopping this virus.

They are doing it, because they don't have any option left. Govt can impose lockdown for next year, no issues with them. But they know that India's socio-economic order will then deteriorate to such an extent, that they won't be able to control it. It would be anarchy, and chaos.

Solution?

Help, help and help those who fall sick, and keep your fingers crossed.

May God help India.

Edit: Removed some objectionable terms, which was deemed unfit for the community.",Poor migrants workers not able to maintain 'social distancing' are not fools. They are helpless.,Coronavirus," Meanwhile we have infinite quantity of edible food stuff rotting away in the FCI. Also rats eat away at a good quantity if them and ofcourse the govt officials black market them too but they too pin it on the rats People who are shitting on migrants should really pause and reflect what they would have done if they were in a situation where one has to decide between maintaining physical distancing or food/house security. They have been dealt with the worst from of apathy by the government and the middle class of this country. This pandemic has made me realise what privilege actually is. Well, social distancing is a privilege to higher middle class and rich. Well, I had an argument with a person claiming to belong to the poor strata of society a few days back on this forum. He said that poor people are deliberately screwing up lockdown to despise Modiji and upper classes. Almost everyone with an access to internet only spread Modi or Gandhi shit. 

There are some people who eats politicians shit. The rest are those who loves India.

You can either love your country or love a politician. U can't love both the things together. 

Unfortunately - those who eats political shit are rich enough to afford a health and luxury life. 

Just one thing... Tell me how can an R&B laborer work from Home? I heard a news from US during a university graduation, the 40 students had almost like 400,000 or so (4 million ? not sure..) debt towards education fee and loan. The one man who inaugurated the event paid off all their debt.

&#x200B;

The quote I see in the comment still strikes me;

&#x200B;

when all the other comments were praising the man who just give away 10's and 100's million dollars, like charity.

&#x200B;

The comment said only this, why are we celebrating this rather than discussing how come the 40 were in debt pursuing education and why one man has all the wealth to just pay off these debts in one mere minute?

&#x200B;

Not so different in India, I guess. I have not drank, nor stocked up on any alcohol for the last three months. Instead, i removed an estimate of how much i would spend on drinks and donated it to that Zomato charity. Same with cigarettes.

I cant do alot , but i could atleast donate. But this treatment by the government, has me raging. And on top of that, they say they handled it well and blamed the opposition for doing nothing. 

The people in power who had a chance to do somethign about this crisis, did nothing while people just walked home. 

Fuck, this country is ruled by ""Humans""... Cant compare them with animals as animals have been shown to have some compassion. And hungry. Poor ! Even educated folks who have the option aren't doing social distancing. 

I'm right now going through an annual bank audit, and the auditors don't give a shit about social distancing or wearing masks. The stock audit could have been done provisionally via video call and when things settle down they could physically verify it. But no! We have to do physical audit with no social distancing. One of the auditors also mentioned that someone in their lane died of covid! Quick question. 

Why don't the majority of the labourers stay back? Most employers are still providing food and shelter. Infact, many in migrant-populated regions are requesting labourers to wait back, doubling salaries etc. Yet, they want to travel and jeopardize the safety. 

Should we feel sorry for those who are travelling back home because they have no option? Yes

Feel sorry for those who are leaving only because govt is providing free transportation? No

Industries are suffering. 
Labour camps provide the staff with everything they want. Their demands are being met. Yet, they leave because they are bored. Worse yet, many don't even inform that they are leaving. Just hop over the gate at midnight and flee."
n2owj9,,"Banners with instructions of ""Not to make Video or photograph of any funeral rites as its against culture of 'Hindu Religion' and If found it will be punishable offence"" seen outside crematorium in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.",Politics," How did they get time and money for this now? But is this really legal ? Can they actually treat this as an offense ? If so, under which law ?

Isn't this kind of too religious (and unfounded) and absurd ? Just shows that Bisht's trying a bit too hard to protect his image (gorakhpur MP). This reminds me that BJP live-streamed the last rites of ABV. What the fuck happened to the ""Hindu culture"" then? Dying from Covid is also a crime in UP.

Please avoid Photo/videography. Doing so is punishable offence - Nagar Nigam, Gorakhpur, UP) 

Across all of UP such Banners are put up to curb recent videography and photography incident which went viral showing true condition of mortality in state of which Uttar Pradesh State Government is in complete denial...

Also just to put it out there, Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji's last rites were broadcasted live across country, with foreign dignitaries attending it...So doesn't have much to do with 'Hindu Religion'.. Its just, Hypocrisy ki bhi Seema hoti hai... Good lord, the extent to which Yogi will go to suppress his failures. An imbecile he is and he needs to go asap. Also, since when is this against the 'Hindu religion'? How rigid is Hinduism according to these people? And if it honestly was against the religion, why did they keep mum when funeral rites were shown in movies? Didn't know Manusmriti mentioned cameras. Indians really were advanced before. Yeah, I bet there are verses in Manu Smriti banning use of photography.

Well, this is UP & I can't blame the government. This is what people of UP want after all, when they voted for BJP. Classic UP Prime example of bending religious laws according to ones will so they can keep feeding lies unto bhakts so they continue supporting them. We should all go and appeal Bisht to arrest everyone who had a camera during Bajpai's funeral. I believe literally every single news channel was present there? 

Rules work in all the cases right? _Right_?"

Captain Leader Legend❤️ Man of Steel , Unlike those so-called celebrities who had given their Twitter accounts to Bhakts . Jordan Henderson of Indian football. What a captain! Better than Virat Kohli and rest of the cricket gang who were BCCI and Govt shills I think I've seen some footballers show more spine during the farmer's protest too. Is it something about the sport? Or do the have less to lose? Or do they depend on the political wolves less? Look at this Virat Kohli and eat his shit. 👏 The real captain This is awesome!"

Ever since I’ve been politically conscious (read: 14 years old), I’ve only seen BJP in power.    
I don’t really have anything to compare them with.     
Was my life easier when congress’ was at the centre? Idk I was busy playing farmville.    
And now I am trapped in a polarised world filled with filter bubbles and echo chambers.    
How tf is anyone (born post 2000) supposed to have an unbiased political opinion? For those who might not know - the person she's talking to, Howard Zinn, was a phenomenal American historian, and a wonderful human being who fought on the frontlines in many American struggles for justice. I was there, I used to live in Gujarat during that time. It was very bad for muslims and many hindus. Many non-gujarati shops were burned, my neighbours and friends were replaced with unknown people, their houses taken at gun point. I used to travel by bus, there was an area mostly populated by muslims on the bus route, it became a ghost town after the riots. The new neighbours used to boast about what happened, what they did etc. They hated muslims with a passion, we could do nothing, did nothing. Link to video or who she’s talking to? But who listens to sound minded people in this country ? Your are soon gonna be forced to say something very similar to Heil Modi or something idk, whoever comes after him Be it yug1 or Mohan Bhagwat the leader of the RSS. I dont care what right wing says about her but after watching couple of videos of her. She make sense many times Warned who, the west? Indians knew what bjp and rss was, atleast the voting ones. They knew it then and now people publically cheer for hindu rashtra slogans so they definitely know now. I remember the Gujarat  riots. I was pretty young back then but as a nerd read a lot about this stuff, call it may be morbid curiosity combined with utter disgust and horror. Was probably 12 or 13 and this stuff gave me night mares for months. Some of the things once you read you just can't unread or get it out of your mind. Such vile things. Hearing it again in the video kinda scares me. To think they succeeded. I religiously read all of her essays. One of the smartest thinkers and most articulate communicators of our times. Im saving up money. One day hopefully I can leave this country forever and settle in some non religious country. Hindu nationalism is getting worse."

> When the Congress passed the Purna Swaraj resolution in its Lahore session in December 1929, and called upon all Indians to celebrate 26 January 1930 as Independence Day, Hedgewar issued a circular asking all the RSS shakhas to observe the occasion through hoisting and worship of the Bhagwa Dhwaj (saffron flag), rather than the Tricolor (which was, by consensus, considered the flag of the Indian national movement at that time). 1930 was the only year when the RSS celebrated 26 January and it stopped the practice from the next year onwards.

This is a great put down by UT to troll bjp while acknowledging the limitations of the Sena. They are actually viable party to vote for in the next election for a large bunch of people who would have never voted for the older Sena.

Now you got the perfect **recipe** for winning... and that's what matters... politicians are in it to win it... at any cost. More than religion, it should be stupidity. People are not following protocols. In between there should be modi holding both there hands Religion is a man made scam 

Ultra religious, orthodox & stupid mindless sheep is what people become.
Religion always always brings superstition and blind faith.

Then comes ,
My religion is superior than yours 
Believe or get ready for a war.
Religious institutions rob in the name of fear,
People force other to convert to their religion,
kill each other in the name of religion,

I really don't understand how this country survives... Politics is fine, religion is just stupid, Why do people want to live life according to a book that was written a million years ago, Sounds Counterintutive and points to only one thing, the lack of ideas and philosophy in human society , To quote the Reverend mother from Dune

""When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movement becomes headlong-faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thought of obstacles and forget that a precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late.""

Edit: spelling MK Stalin from DMK is exactly this one. Hindu hater and a bad politician I would replace politics there with tradition, or culture, or sanskaar.

politics is just a by-product, for me."

Is that a fair summation of events? Most people still don't know why farmers are protesting, And this is 2020, people will not read up on the articles mentioned in the main thread, even if people of reddit do the students of WhatsApp university will not. That is why we need videos for sharing and spreading information. I know YouTube is not a reliable source of information but all the links that I am sharing here are from reputed creators who mention sources. This is a grave issue and media will not cover these so we will have to do it.

THIS NEEDS ATTENTION! **Why only Punjab and Haryana?**

First it is not, not anymore. More states have joined. The farmers from BJP ruled states, i.e. Haryana, UP, and MP, who went to join the protest on Nov 26, were stopped and detained. Now many of them have joined, including farmers from Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. Many more are joining.

Second, farm Unions have always (at least in the last few decades) been strongest in Punjab and Haryana, followed by western UP, MP, Rajasthan, and Maharastra. Holding massive protests is not easy. It requires unity, awareness, and lot of groundwork. People don't wake up one day, to go protest for a month. Thus while there are more farmers in Bihar, and their condition is much worse, uniting them for protest is still not easy.

Third protest in Delhi will always be overwhelmingly represented by neighboring states. But many protests are already happening in different parts of the country, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal etc.

*Sidenote: This agenda by the party and its IT Cell to portray this protest as only from Punjab and Haryana is their tried and tested method. Friends, I would only ask you to try to listen and understand the concern of the farmers, before passing your own judgement. These people who are protesting are not dumb or fools who can't think for themselves.* So peaceful protest is met with atrocities? Update: People are still holed up inside the Red Fort. 10 Regiments of CRPF will be coming in. This govt has changed the Jai Kisan slogan to Die Kisan. Popcorn time [https://twitter.com/diljitdosanjh/status/1334421071424970752](https://twitter.com/diljitdosanjh/status/1334421071424970752) What's the point of making a megathread and pinning it if you're not gonna update it. While the home minister had appealed to all farmers unions, he had personally called three farmer leaders – Joginder Singh Ugrahan, president of Bharti Kisan Union (Ugrahan), Jagjit Singh Dallewal, president of Bharti Kisan Union( Sidhupur) and Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of BKU (Rajewal).

Ugrahan added that Surjit Kumar Jyani, chairperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s eight-member panel, formed to hold talks with Punjab farmers, had proposed that a five-member team of their union can talk with Shah in person. “I refused straight away as we are not the only union protesting for the cause,” the leader said.

Besides, different unions are protesting at different sites, Ugrahan added. “Unless everyone is called for a meeting, we will not pursue any meeting,” he said.

*Center trying to factionalize the united protests.* The SC is working with the Government to disperse the protests, don’t let the dulcet tones of yesterday and the headline fool you. The concern Bobde seems to harbour for the elderly and women who have been “kept” in the protest is to unsettle the protests as the elderly and women participate in massive numbers. 

This is the profile of the committee Bobde is keen on:

-**Ashok Gulati**-  Called demonetization Modi’s boldest political and economic decision. His stance the farm-laws has been pro-Govt.

___

-**Bhupinder Singh Mann** is a BKU leader and a former Rajya Sabha MP but he has not been part of the 41 farmer union leaders protesting against the farm laws & who are in talks with Govt. He is on the Committee. His stance should
be clear from this:

“Farmers' organisations from Haryana, Maharashtra, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, which support the three new farm laws, met Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in Krishi Bhawan on Monday afternoon. They handed over a memorandum demanding that the three laws be implemented, with some amendments. The farmers groups come under the banner of the All India Kisan Coordination Committee (AIKCC), which was founded by the late Sharad Joshi, and is now chaired by former **Rajya Sabha MP Bhupinder Singh Mann**.”

-Another member, P Joshi writes:
“Finally, the farmer associations are demanding the complete withdrawal of new farm laws. It is bizarre to try and justify such rejection when farmers are being given more options on markets. If anyone is adversely affected, it is the traders/middlemen, especially from Punjab and Haryana. Various non-farm organisations and a few intellectuals who are supporting the farmers’ demands must realise that the demands are unworthy of such support.”

This is a well-worked sham to undermine the protests, hand the Government more time and to finally endorse the three farm laws. At some point we will have to move to a less agrarian economy where a huge part of the population cannot work in something as sporadic as agriculture.There is a trust problem from the government’s side as well.They haven’t done nearly enough to create stable jobs so people can move away from agriculture while agricultural input prices have gone up.They have always endorsed loan waivers as shortcuts to win votes which discourages formal credit from entering the system making farmers dependent on social ties,middlemen and informal loans.We can’t have a government announcing massive reforms without consultation.This move fast and worry later policy of the government has to stop.Their shock policies have way too many downstream effects which they fail to acknowledge and keep drowning out any opposition.I’m not completely in opposition of these farm bills but this irresponsible governance has to stop."

It's about BJP... they are desperate for votes in Tamilnadu than Delhi... You know we are only state that didn't vote for BJP last election Posts like these will be very conveniently ignored by RW subs They are holding Delhi hostage. man I do feel bad for the delhites.

Modi is out for blood. What a biggot. BJP hates every state that hasn't elected it. Kerala. Bengal. Delhi. Maharashtra. Punjab. I won't be surprised at all if Modi's face is plastered on the ration bags. People shouldn't show these fuckers mercy when they fall out of power, they have caused lasting damage to the country via precedent. Bharatiya jumla party , what else can you expect from them ? Here in TN, BJP is going to give a tough competition to NOTA. You know democracy is dead when the only party in india which came up independently in the last 10 years isn't allowed to function properly. It's like stifling a whole generation's voices. Now we know the real reason Delhi Law was passed by Loksabha... 


BJP in centre is afraid of work of AAP..... so they gave powers to LG

AAP - started program of hoisting flags to take away nationalism agenda point 

They started free pilgrimage for old people to Ram temple and other places to take away Hindutva agenda point 

New deshbhakti curriculum in schools to take away nationalism point....

Modi finally made India 1st in something big, so proud, how about you?


Just to be clear, I'm being very sarcastic here. u/savemp4

Need to send to my bhakt father. I could see the horror in the hosts eyes. Man fuck this shit, it's all carnage here. What y'all think is the exact death figure per day? My estimate is 15-20 k Or even more than that. Crematorium are full everywhere, dead bodies are found in ambulance. Just think of people(mostly Dalits) preparing for dead bodies and burning them. Meanwhile our paid msm discussing useless exit poll results. This is due to Gandhi and Nehru our government is doing excellent work Why hasnt mode ordered the the army dealing with logistics ? Why arent they visible on the streets to enforce some sense of order ?

They may  not be able to provide oxygen, but they can make life easier. Help with cremations .. with anything. The chinese deployed the army .. italians relied on their armed forces to help with cremations.

What the f\*%@ is modi doing ? this is the opportunity where media influences like Rana Ayubb and others should use International MSM to show the condition of India and get Modi resign. If Modi survives this he will be PM for next 15 years. In fact we should raise the incompetence of Modi to UN.

In no condition we can habe Modi or RSS/BJP.

Had it be any other govt we would have fraction of cases. This mother fucker will be re-elected, people will forget about what all shit he put us through, we’ll continue to live in purgatory I heard muslim graveyards are massively falling short of space and existing burial sites especially in cities (I am from Mumbai). Burial grounds are being reused at a rapid rate, Existing graves are being re-dug even where the earlier corpse has not fully decomposed. The old partially decomposed corpse which was wrapped in cloth is then compressed and pushed to aside to the corner to accommodate the new body within the same pit area."

Misguided ~~Kashmiri Youth~~ Priorities

Mis~~led Punjab Farmers~~ placed Pride It's literally insane how many people have come out spouting the same nonsense of ""kHaLisTaNi"" at the protesting farmers, they make it more and more clear that when they lick the boots of BJP, it's not because of nationalism, rather because of hatred for other religions along with wanting a supremacy of their own faith. Even if these people are indeed misguided/misled/brainwashed - the government should focus on quality education at all levels to fix this.  


Instead, they're busy censoring netflix.

Example : killing the pujari of the ram mandir in ayodhya during the rath yaatra, ask erstwhile VHP president Pravin togadia what they did to him in Gujarat. How is BJP even a major party anymore. They are an experiment of expanding the Overton window at this point. First a few fringe groups state one thing until the majority party adopts it. How is Love Jihad different from  Ghar Wapsi. I mean Pakistan has a pretty terrible Ulema force but the state stays away from divisive rhetoric. The religious parties never get to 10% seats and are inconsequential."

Gaand mein dum nhi, hum kisi se kam nhi Dalli police using tax money for everything besides what the tax money is for. Quick to file such FIRs to make political statements. If it was a rape case they’d need coddling from a superior or a lawyer instead of the victim’s statement. Greta will be like “Yeah right.... that’s gonna stop me.” So there is an IPC section to stop any criticism of BJ Pee gobarment! Fodi hai to kuch bhi mumkin hai.

 Sections in FIR are **124 A IPC-spreading disaffection against the govt of India**. This is regarding sedition, 153 A-promoting hatred amongst various communities on social/cultural/religious grounds, same is 153 & 120 B for criminal conspiracy to give shape to such a plan.

Haha...This Bullshit must be like wildfire on WhatsApp...

Hit & Run by BJP... FIR won't help much as Damage is already done! It looked fake beforehand. Looks like the clean chit given to BV Srinivas by the DP led to this.
After their first line of attack - misusing government agencies - backfired, looks like they've fallen back to the time-tested method: use social media.

The BJP realizes that the two things that unites their flock is (a) hatred for Pakistan and (b) hatred for the Congress. Now, implicating Pakistan into this Corona shit-show is too far-fetched. Even bhakts are not _that_ stupid. So inventing a story that involves the Congress and that new word, ""toolkit"" is simply an attempt to keep the faithful together. While this is horrible it shows that the BJP is aware of it's failures and that they have a better game plan to bring themselves down than the Congress. BJP does everything except making good policies and being useful to the country."

gtx97b,,Created by Mradul Jain,Non-Political," jessica as daya ben please Jetha Lal seems to have lost weight Morty - oh *geez rick*

Rick- DadaJi bol saale Rinku and Moorthy To be fair, you have to have a very high Veda Quotient to understand Rickuchacha and Moorthy. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the Upanishads most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rickuchaha's nāstika outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from ājvīka literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rickuchacha & Moorthy truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rickuchacha's moksha shloka ""वुब्ब लुब्ब दुब् दुब् ,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Mahāvīra's Jain agama Bhagvati Sūtra. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Guru Harmonavardhan's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 Morty looks like small Hitler wtf Pai Lagu Ricky ji As Indian, this shit is funnier than pickle rick.

hb7mdt,"Just yesterday my friend got a group video call of our college friends i was lying on bed trying to sleep. They didn't had idea i wasin the same room. I was thinking that as it is a video call i will be added in there soon, they were cracking jokes like we all did in college it had been 10 minutes no one even talked about me and almost everyone was in the call except 2 muslims. (One was me) they were planing to play games together which i insisted them to playin college days i teached them for hours.

Someone asked should i add mohammadd\*\*\*\*\* to roast him (gan\* marenge uski bulake) one of my frnd with whom we went to so many places and did everything like close friends i cant even relate the bond to anything he said "" KOI MULLA NAHI CHAHIE BC IDHR BAS HAM LOG RAHENGE"" 

(NO (MUSLIMS) ARE NEEDED HERE ONLY WE HINDUS Will talk)

&#x200B;

This line killed me instantly on while i was on bed i asked myself am i still not acceptable by hindus becouse as a muslim i have heard  these similar terms a whole lot of times in life.

"" Do they consider me Pakistani""?

"" But i always helped them in entire time i was with them""?

I was dying by these lines shooting me in my head

&#x200B;

What killed me more 8 who were in on call didn't said anything and it was okay for everyone the call lasted for 40 minutes approx i was half dead on bed.

Please stop saying this guys spread these words i haven't slept properly since tomorrow 😞

{Sorry for bad grammer}

Edit 1'::Please stop considering i am saying all Muslims are innocent and only being supressed i posted it to request people to raise your voice since you are of same religion we love this country as much as you do...

&#x200B;

EDIT 2 : 

I an going to explain now in detail why i wrote this post,

since people are calling me insensitive

\`\`\`\` i had made fun of myself too on my name, religion , name of gd as suicide bomber slogans like Allaho Akber etcetc or on Circumcised etc etc,. i don't get offended but people sometime seriously say stuff which kills i feel like the joker who made laugh everyone but at the end of the day is sad himself. my few hindu friends are very nice to me but they dont know how to react when someone say this they say 'oye rehne de' bro this won't work please clear the doubts he have for muslims and for those who say i should have talked to him mere bolne se he will temprarily accept his mistake but he should be corrected by the sources he was made to think like that. i.e.  most of 80's parents my friend says his parent are like this no one can do anything to thier thinking, 

>\`\`\`I have seen my bestfriend ''manisha's'' mom throwing my sewai of eid after i went away from her home but I mean a lot to manisha i cant do a shit about her mom if she cant take a stand,       her mom is firm beliver we do black magic in everything \`\`\` i didnt cried for this i understand her mother was raised up like that.

once my neibhour said to shopkeeper ""are yar kal raat daru pee thi ye katuo pe bharosa ni krna chahie bc murga bata kar mutton khila dia'' {' hey man don't trust these muslims we drank yesterday and he told me its chicken and he made me eat mutton (goat or sheep flesh)'} i was standing thr we know him since 10 years or more i was shocked i saw pride in his eyes saying it on my face i was 15 years old that time i was clueless wht to say to defend myself and say uncle i am not like that.

Should have confronted him then and there....there is a chance some in the group may have supported you....silence only encourages these assholes It's sad and it is wrong. For the commenters here, please oppose any such bigotry you encounter in daily life. We have to stand with our Muslim brothers. i saw a poster on reddit on blm protest   

>not all trump supporters are racists, but all of them decided that racism is not a deal breaker   

convert this in indian context, and it still holds 100% true An Indian Hindu here.

Hey man, It's sad to hear that religious difference even happen between friends. Friendship should not see any religion or caste or culture. 

They don't deserve you. 

A note to fellow Indians and especially to Hindus:

It's high time man. If we won't be able to differentiate Religion from Nationality, the future of this country would be filled with War and Hatred as the past has been. It is one's right to follow whatever religion he/she wishes to, but it should not be a factor to differentiate. 

Religion does not make anyone a bad person, it is the blind followers who do. 

Stay Blessed Indians. I remember in college we were in mess, maybe 7-8 people. We were discussing about some politician who happened to be a Muslim.

One said - 'ye Musalte to saale sab....' other people reminded him that I was sitting there. Quickly the topic changed. I didn't stay there for long after that They're not your friends!

Try to stay as far as possible from people like these.

Stay in touch but don't give them too much of your time or importance. 

This is one way to do it.

One other thing you can do is to confront and ask that guy(In a friendly but confrontational way) why he said what he said. If i was you, i would do this but you don't have to do this. Sometimes walking away is the best answer.

Edit : To emphasize my point [here's](https://imgur.com/a/pqdJME1) an image! I'm sorry you had to hear that. It sucks but try and remind yourself that not all people think that way. It's just a couple of uncivilised freaks. People are ready to be divided on any lines just to get a sense of belonging, the only belonging I need is of an Indian. My friend you can dump them and talk to me, a fellow Indian. I'm sorry this happened to you. Those assholes are **NOT** your friends. My bestfriend is a Muslim and one of the smartest people I know. If anyone ever dared to ignore her or ostracize her because of her religion I would fight them to death. You deserve better friends. Friends who love you and respect you for who you are. Fuck them. My friends post very racist posts on insta and when i used to confront them, they said ""You are not like the others"" I hate this line. I don't talk to them anywhere."

i0ozbk,,Anything for a Rajya Sabha Seat,Politics," 'I heard Arnab was called in for questioning...' FYI, this is contempt of court. (not just the artist drawing and writing the cartoon but you posting it). 

Source: I have a law degree.

edit: I'm not endorsing the situation; most civilised countries have sharply reduced the scope of contempt jurisdiction. Unfortunately, while a freedom exists to criticise the legal reasoning of any particular judgment or the legal reasoning behind a set of judgments, anything that brings or in the opinion of the court will tend to bring into disrepute the judiciary falls under contempt. In a scenario where a judge was in fact caught creating a drunken public nuisance, any factual reporting of the incident was also deemed to be contemptuous. And not just any contempt of court. Contempt of court by a person holding mirror to governments and courts and pointing out their corrupt ways. These high and mighty judges don't see contempt of court in frivolous lawsuits being repeatedly filed, like the ones akong for destroying the secular constitution of india, or the frivolous case filed by pilot gang preventing the speaker from doing his job, which the supreme court's own constitutional bench has said no court can intervene in. Add EIA and government inefficiency please. First panel should be:

lpit69,"They don't use their blinkers. 

They overtake on roads where they shouldn't. 

They don't slow down near zebra crossings. 

When they are near a zebra crossing, they are in a rush to speed ahead of the guy trying to cross the road and make him walk back. 

Just dumb useless idiots who are trying to save 10 minutes a day by driving too fast. 

They will even park over your chest with a smile. 

They don't know basic stuff or they are too lazy to use their knowledge. 

India needs to introduce more standards for driving schools and driving tests and fail more dumb people.

Since people are too reckless and feckless, maybe increase the driving age?",90% Indians don't know how to drive. Go ahead and hate on me.,Non-Political," The issue is, its too easy to get a license here. Issued to people who don't even know when to change gears. In india you learn level 5 (mission impossible/transporter/ Bourne identity/ FnF) first, then the rest of mundane stuff (indicators, etiquettes.. honking is a language here)

Also, here you learn to swim by being thrown off into waterbodies

You learn to win by pulling others down

And you learn to live by ripping fellow mates.

We are a lot of population. This breeds competition, but lack of emphasis on competency breeds unfair practices and that breeds corruption.

But yeah.. go ahead and hate me. Only 90%? Always thought it was higher. Let me add to your list:

* Signals are just a suggestion to some drivers
* They will carry out high speed overtake on the side that your indicator is indicating
* At signals, they stop on the zebra crossing
* No understanding of which lanes can be used to take right turns at a signal
* Multilane jumping is quite common
* Free left turns are usually blocked by someone hoping to save 5 seconds
* At circles, they won't wait till the circle is a little free causing a circular jam where no one can go anywhere.
* They insist on having their discussions on the road while on different bikes.

The only way I can see to solve this is a point system where each misdemeanor gets you a proportional number of points, after x points you are not permitted to drive and if found doing so is jail time.

Also fines shouldn't be fixed but a percentage of the cost of the vehicle. Higher percentages for worse offenses. 

I just haven't figured the logistics in enforcing this since the cops will take their bribes and avoid high end vehicles to avoid goons and bigshots Driving in India is like playing a video game. You never know where someone is going to pop up from. It's not even about the standards for driving schools.  
It's just one big issue that's rattling India- ""CORRUPTION""  
Jitne bhi badiya driving schools le aao, measures rakh lo people will still get a driving license by means of bribing. issue is discipline... Indians don’t want to follow discipline in public place...
there is no mutual understanding, or consideration of next person in front... it’s all about me... indian are fucking egoists.

Most people know rules, they know driving but still they don’t follow any.

corruption or dumbness is lesser issue when it comes to streets... I completely agree, but more then bring bad drivers, I think it's like a no win situation, if you try to drive safe and follow all the rules, the other drivers treat you badly, how many times I have waited obidiently  at the traffic light only for some taxi, auto or some other guy to come behind me, stay honking and abusing as if I stopped, in the middle of the road, to do a party.
How many times I started in lane, only to see two wheelers, autos and even buses to do zig Zag around me, you just feel like fucki it, I'm just ranting, you are right The zebra crossing aren't even maintained all of them have been wiped out... https://youtu.be/xGfLNqjh4j0

Reminded me of this. Lol Samir, you're breaking the car! Indians don't drive well and it is a feedback loop. You see an eratic driver and keep an eye on them while driving which sometimes leads to you forgetting the road rules. On Indian roads at any point in time there are at least 6 people trying to kill you."

And now the article won’t appear on the first page. This is exactly the purpose of their IT cell. They share Indian High Commission's response letter related links in their massive groups. Lakhs of people press the links and open the pages. Google and other search algorithms, based on the high traffic on these pages, show those links at the top to the rest of the world.

It's one of many tricks in the so called search engine optimization. Rich celebrities, corporations caught doing something bad also hire people to do SEO, like trying to push the links containing the bad news to 2nd or 3rd or 10th page in the search results (we go beyond the 1st page rarely). (Disclosure: I work at Google. But I'm speaking in my personal capacity as a programmer and not as an employee).

Do you realize how difficult it'd be to tweak the algorithms to bias them for something like this? And big companies have to keep a record of all the code that has ever been in production. Do you think a US based company would risk their neutral position for a political leader in India? 

If you were looking for the article with that exact title, you could search it with quotes like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22modi+leads+india+into+viral+apocalypse%22&oq=%22modi+leads+india+into+viral+apocalypse%22).  The Scroll and Wire articles are recent and locally relevant (because you are searching from India)  and that is probably why they are being ranked higher. Moreover, they contain The Australian's link so they provide a complete picture to the user than the original article only. Hah. Gonna use VPN for both Porn and news from now on I guess. Damn... Google must have been under too much pressure from modi. I wonder how it would be manipulating all the data searches related to severity of covid. Duckduckgo is literally a blessing Use DuckDuckGo. Google is notorious for political bias in their results. Google is fixing search results in India this is very clear. Google isn't messing up the search. Your search terms contain words like Modi, viral apocalypse, these are a perfect or near perfect match with article in the Australian but, that article was published 2 days ago, Google has just arranged the search results chronologically. Also the Time article at the bottom of the page is 6 days old.
In the words of the Hand of Our Supreme Leader, app chronology samjhiye. :)
The Scroll article is in top inspite of being published 5 hours after the Wire article coz Scroll has more ads than the Wire page.

ncgcd3,,The good old 90's days,Non-Political," ROAD RASH!! They’re all early 2000s for me at least. I remember that squeaking noise that puppy house made. We place a coin and let it drag inside no ? :P

Some good memories with my sister. Thanks OP The shooting the ducks game was the real OG.
You'd feel like John fuckin Wick. The sound effects were epic. XYZZY Spoon Shift+1 Though I am not a 90s kid , the moment I saw those calcium tablets in the bottom right , I was able the recall its scent and flavour ....aah nostalgia I think people born between 1990 and 1999 are the lucky ones. 

People like us have literaly seen the world changing. 

From huge fatass television to very thin led tv now. 

From black and white telephones to mini touch computer on our hands.

From VHS to netflix.

From floppy disks to cloud.

We have tasted the world which was before 90s to the modern we are living today. People born in 70s and 80s still struggle to navigate the modern tech. We were born on it. We were molded by it. Isnt that house the one that grabs the coin? Thank you for the memories. i still play road rash baby.its a classic. To this day eating calcium sandos is my dream. I hope it tastes as nice as the box looks. Still have the exact same video game (pic 2) and working just like new."
ndjkkx,"Situation of our country is beyond control- Shameless veils of propaganda and false images are getting disseminated thread by thread, day by day.

This directly hurts the oppressors- Narendra is not the culprit alone, it's whosoever has invested in his image- RSS, RWingers, shady crony industrialists..

Know this- They are losing, They are getting exposed. They will do ANYTHING in the book of tricks to get us distracted, polarized, divided.

Don't believe me? Go see the ever new manufactured hashtags- SSR warriors are alive again, Israel, Virat hindus , Dhruv Rathee.. anyone is a scapegoat.. EVERYONE a distraction.

THIS is information warfare against its own people.

BEWARE, citizens of India, now is the time to REMEMBER and unite for good, remember what we stand for, use critical thinking, step aside all differences and be ONE to remember who divided us, used us, and left us for dead.

We are beaten and let down. But we rise, we stick together, we hustle and we fight for our India.

Edit: Thanks y'all for the overwhelming response, my intention is only to call out the information warfare, not fear mongering. So we can think and act better, and United.

I'll keep posting this reminder- as promised, with some insights on constructs of mass control (we all know bits and pieces anyway, but a demon needs to be named to get a power over it). My first (yesterday's) reminder post was removed quite shortly, but I will keep my end of promise.

Plus, I'm not sure why, but some comments are getting shadow banned- not that it matters bcz the original intention is ONLY to call out, and keep our collective memory safe from distractions.",BEWARE!!! Distractions are coming. And I will post this everyday as a reminder for our fragile memories.,Politics," I left twitter for good  as i am typing this , big meeting going on in Noida , with Noida news anchors , expect major distractions. Also positive talks सकारात्मक सोच  also trending and something like this is on trending page on twitter [deleted] Were Anupam Kher's recent statements part of distraction strategy? # ""United we stand, divided we fall"" Whatever we may try. There will be India Pakistan or India China encounter in 2023  at the border; Pakistan one we can even fabricate, we have the capabilities. This is something we have been regularly doing in the Northeast, fake skirmish, encounters etc etc. Govt has all tricks up it's sleeves. India Pakistan encounter, Balakot strikes, was major reason for 2019 victory , it's a tried and tested formula. Even then what was conveniently hidden from the public and media was death for IAF personnel in Helicopter crash by own missile attack. This was never covered. No one from Govt even acknowledged the lives lost. There were no ceremonies. Everything was brushed under the carpet of ""return Of Abhinandan"" , "" destruction of terrorist camps which was never proven and downed F-16, which was again never established inspite of all possible technologies we have today. I remember a Air Marshal rank senior officer was made to face the media with scraps of amraam missile as proof.  This Govt can go to any extreme to retain power, even fake a terrorist attack. They have already positioned a hardliner sycophant puppet as CDS who prefers to visit temples with UP CM on Navy day rather attend Navy day ceremonial guard and flag hoisting. One of my most favourite subreddits is r/TheRightCantMeme. It's a place where people repost US Rightwing Propaganda memes and basically make fun of it while also deconstruting and disproving the message the meme is putting forward.

We can do the same, and create another dedicated space for it. Though the meme culture among the Right Wing in India is not as popular and evolved as the US, but we can still post just RW Social Media posts or narratives with the intention of making fun of the silliness of them and people in the comments can say how the argument is wrong.

Visit the page, if you don't know it already and you'll get an idea of what I'm talking about.

If there are enough people on board, we can start a new subreddit, or maybe just start from here and see how it goes. Israel and Palestine hashtags is one of such distractions. Army personnel. Please stay safe. Thoughts and prayers I said this before and I'll keep saying it - Remember your hate. Don't fall for the distractions and remember the hate and pain this government is causing you.

luw4cj,,'No Vote To BJP': A People’s Campaign in Bengal Reaches Remote Villages,Politics," It needs to reach the whole India. This is like the Alexei Navalny movement in Russia! Keep it going, folks!! tldr; A group of people in West Bengal has started a campaign called 'No Vote To BJP' to stop BJP from coming into power in the state Assembly elections. The campaign is led by a forum called 'Bengal against Fascist RSS-BJP', which has 48 convenors operating from Kolkata. The forum has been actively campaigning in over 90 out of the 294 assembly segments in the West Bengal.

*Summary generated by [sansa](https://sansa.news/)* This is exactly what needs to happen. if this gains momentum, it will back fire. it always has. when you put so much focus on the opposition rather than focusing on real issues you make the opposition look bigger than they are supposed to be. you will have indirectly helped them reach a wider audience than they could have on their own!

this is why gat bandhan failed

edit: i suggest that in campaigns do not even take the name of modi or amit. the fewer times people hear that name the fewer the associations formed in their mind. instead attack the issues and the BJP party's local representative who will in all likelihood be weaker than modi. make that person the target Bengal is a shitshow man, I mean I don't find TMC any better. It's a shame to see one of the most intellectually influential state having to endure such administration Can we still trust our EC ? [removed] While I myself am not pro-BJP (not anymore, at least), what other party is there (strictly speaking for the formation of the Central Government (and not the State Governments))? Ma durga must protect you, you guys are on a dangerous crusade.

n4p7cj,"Hello everyone, hope you're all staying safe and healthy during this difficult time.

My name is Rishiraj Chakravarty, some of you may remember me from my earlier posts here. I asked for some help and many of you responded and some even helped me out financially. I will be forever grateful for that.

I just wanted to let you all know that I have finally cleared my class 10 exams. This is absolutely a ""Pappu pass ho gaya"" situation for me. If you're wondering why it took so long for me to pass, well I dropped out of school when my mental and physical health started deteriorating and my family could no longer afford to send me to a regular school. I joined NIOS in 2014 and ever since then my physical and mental health issues got the better of me and I couldn't think straight... Forget studying, I had no will to live. After four psychiatrists failed to help me in any way, I decided to fight my demons myself and I conquered them.

Right now, I just want some advice. My financial situation is still disastrous and with the pandemic raging on, I fear what is going to happen to us. On my previous post a person offered me a content writing internship, I was very grateful for it but unfortunately at the time I was going through far too many problems and uncertainties that I couldn't deliver what was asked of me. The internship was for a month with a possibility of extending it, but I quit after a month since an acquaintance was pursuing me for a call centre job, I also had to take care of many problems and go out of town with my mother as she was trying to get a job. The call center job didn't last long and my mother didn't get the job either. I still feel guilty that I couldn't deliver as per expectation during the internship and I left so abruptly.

So what do I do now? What can a 10 pass guy do to survive? What kind of job should I pursue? I am already registered at a consultancy service, and I have appeared for two interviews but I didn't get hired. When looking for jobs online I have found most of the ads are actually from consultantcies. I still haven't used any of the crowdfunding money, it is still my backup plan to buy a scooter and be a Swiggy delivery boy.

There's more than enough scam call centres here in Guwahati, they will hire me without a second thought but I cannot bring myself to scam other people no matter how bad my situation may be. I worked for one scam centre briefly and I absolutely hated it.

Also, before I am called a fraud again I want to make it absolutely clear I am not asking for money. I just want some advice.","At the age of 23, I have finally pass class 10!",Non-Political," 
I hope this milestone helps you find more motivation and positivity to keep ploughing through life. Congratulations bro! 🎉🎉 Omg so excited for you! The turtle will win the race! Keep at it my friend. 



Edit: Also, I think you have a very good grasp of written english and vocabulary. Maybe you can use that to your advantage for your job hunt. Like office assistant etc (if you don’t enjoy content writing). Kind of a foot in the door to corporate life Congratulations. Can suggest a few things from my field. Look at video editing, a drone pilot and also camera assistant. 

You can make decent money from it. Editing can be learn online. From A to Z. For drone also, once you get the basics right, it's a week long thing to practice and then it becomes muscle memory. Know a lot of people who are making a decent amount of money. They are just doing drone shoots for weddings. Talking about people in places like indore, farrukhabad, meerut etc. So that market is open everywhere. 
As a camera attended, in Delhi one makes around 1000-1500 a day for shoot. You need to work hard for that more than anything.  The basics you can learn online. Look up the working of canon 5d and Sony a7s series. Two of the most used dslrs. Pretty much all wedding and corporate shoots are done using those. Learn everything there is to about them. Lenses, settings etc. Download the manual so you will end up knowing most of it. Tons of free resources online. 

Hope this helps. 🎉🎉🎈🎈Congrats !!!!!🎉🎉🎈🎈

Age is just a number!🙂🙂 Congratulations. I'm a mature student myself who started engineering at age 24. Just keep moving forward man. Things you can do online with a few lessons from Udemy, usually 80hrs courses for like 300-600 bucks

1)2d editing softwares like Photoshop/illustrator /Lightroom to become a rounded graphic designer can earn upto (4-8k) 

2) video editing softwares like premiere pro+after effects  to become either video editor/animations (5+10k)

3) content writing - considering your writing skill, u only need a bit of exp (4-8k), digital marketing (4-10k)...imo this would be your easiest option.

4)move to a city if yiu have rent/food issues where the wage to living ratio is less. Since I'm from Odisha Id tell you to move there because it's very Affordable/easy to live in

Like a single room for 2.5k rent in the capital, and the food is relatively cheap. 


If possible by a laptop even second hand is fine and you can start at number 3, with a better pc u can move upto 2 and 1. 

I'm 24, and I can relate to your story. Had a fucked up childhood in a fucked up family until 18, attempted to kill myself at one point, but had to pick myself up by the bootstraps and had to do it all alone.

The only thing I can say to you is, if you achieve emotional and financial independence, even if it's the bare minimum, thered be nothing to stop your progress.

I can't help you financially but if you need someone to talk to/or any kind of help, feel free to dm me. 

Wishing  you all the best. Congrats Rishiraj. You passed and that's allthat matters. Progress is progress. Wishing you more success ahead. Ping me and where you are, maybe I can help. Hey man, you've inspired me. I'll also study further. Congratulations!! I have a cousin who has mental health issues and he is unable to last in his jobs. He works in the hotel industry and does have a degree in hotel management. The surprising thing is however many jobs he quits, he almost immediately gets a new job at another hotel (and good ones like Marriott, Taj, etc.)

You can definitely try that industry. Even if start at a lower level, if you are polite and a hard worker, there are many chances to move up.

All the best for whatever you do! Title should be *passed class 10. This doesn't look good, sorry. Whatever you do our prayers our with u man."
jbdjq7,"Lemme explain. The kind of environment we have in India, we rarely get to interact with the opposite sex. Even more, in smaller places. 
So, people fuck at the opportunity they get, it's normal. 
Except, our legal system is broken. The law itself, on paper isn't bad. But the police, and legal system are notorious for being able to manipulate as well as get manipulated. Which means if you family is influential or rich enough, you can get away with crap. 
For being influential, don't imagine that you need to be Salman Khan level rich. Your mama being local police in some gaon, is influence enough. Your chacha being a criminal  lawyer in the gaon and hanging out with the local police, is influence enough. 

I'm a lawyer, who has seen enough cases where men are behind bars for sleeping with their girlfriend, who turned out to be a minor (17 years). That's statutory rape. 

Before you get into a misogynistic rant, wait. 

It's not about the women either. It's not men versus women. 

Very few cases are filed by those 17 year olds. In fact most tragidies look something like this - 
Boy friend and girl friend fuck. Very often, with little age gap between them. Except the guy has crossed 18 and the girl, hasn't. 

She gets pregnant and decides to get an abortion done without anyone's knowledge. 
She goes to a doctor, except the doctor is obliged by law, to report it to the police as a case of rape if the girl is under 18. If the doctor doesn't, he/she is also committing an offence. 

Those young girls, who just wanted an abortion, now find themselves in the middle of a criminal case, they never intended to file. 

Second case scenario, the couple gets caught. And in India, for the parents - claiming your daughter got raped, is more respectful than admitting that she fucked her boyfriend and enjoyed it (shit 18 years olds around the world do). 

So this is a very complex situation where too many pathetic ideas of Indian society fuck people's lives - it's not men v/s women. 

Also, Indian governments (doesn't matter which one) has a history of trying to ""fix"" the crimes against women by nonsensical freebies like stricter laws. They don't always help. Just gets them temporary brownie points. 

Law isn't going to fix much if it is enforced by the same sexist system, dominated by people with same sexist ideas. 

Real life example - 

I've been asked this directly by a judge, if my client (21 year old) will marry the girl (17 year old) during a rape case. Now in this case, it wasn't a real rape. The guy had so many pictures of them taking holidays together in nearby gaon and lakes. They were having an affair. The girl loved him and even in her own cross examination, admitted to most things no rape victim would admit. I was equally sorry for that girl who was being pressured by her family to do all this. 

However, if it was a real rape. Just imagine. An almost 60 year old judge's solution here is - will the guy marry the girl? 

So, please don't fuck crazy. Don't fuck a woman you can't trust. Don't fuck someone who's family you don't trust. Don't fuck a woman who is 'not' (edited and added) an enthusiastic participant. 
And don't ever fuck a minor.

Edit 1 - oh God. It's a typo. Don't fuck a woman who is NOT an enthusiastic participant.

Edit 2 - 'don't fuck crazy' is a very common urban phrase. Not misogynistic, I'm a woman. I've seen mysogyny first hand having lived in India. I also don't blame women, because I see this as a very nuanced problem than men versus women . 

The point of this post being, don't sleep with crazy people. Of course minors was mainly what my post was about. But it's obviously wider than that. 
Don't fuck women with crazy families. Don't fuck women you can't trust to not fuck with your life. 
Also, before jumping down my throat (those of you, who are doing that), remember as women we always have our system on alert mode. We are careful usually not to sleep with guys who are likely to rape us, etc. Society beats that shit into us, because if raped, we know we will get blamed. 
I'm just telling men to exercise some caution while choosing a woman to sleep with. Get your system a little alert too. You are running some risk here too.","I can't believe I have to say that, but guys, don't fuck crazy...",Unverified," You guys fuck?? Well my depression fucks me most of the days, against my consent. Can i get a divorce PLEASE? [deleted] moral of the story: people should fuck only after 18 and use protection? That's it If I ever get into a relationship I am going to ask her to show her some Pan card or Aadhar card to prove her birthday.. Only if she crosses 25 will I proceed ahead My dad is police officer and recently a case came in which a lady of local minister screwed with someone they were both 21 and even though the lady herself said that it was not a rape and consent was there he got charged for rape and put behind the bars just because the girls dad asked for it Can't fuck crazy if you don't fuck \*taps temple\* Bold of you to assume we fuck. So this this happened few years ago. A friend of mine got caught with a girl, probably intimate I guess. Few days later people found his body in the  jungle. Case was filed against girl's family but didn't reach any conclusions, still going on I guess.
The girl he was in affair with I saw her like a month ago. She is happily married and leaves in abroad now. She was looking stunning and beautiful. 

I have one more advice. Don't fuck with girls having extremely rich daddy. If you do, don't get caught. You forgot to add the Caste angle here. It constitutes a big chunk of rape cases in Himachal, or so I've been told by a cousin who's an advocate. Me who has a small pp and there's no chance I will get these

&#x200B;

Masterstroke incoming at 8pm at your nearest TV screen very soon. Some people clearly want India to be at the top of every chart, even if it's the Covid chart smh. Here's why:

(1) The government is getting a sound beating about the non-postponement of exams on social media. Students are pissed off. Parents are alarmed. The opposition parties have gotten involved.

(2) The B&D media has already been put on the case, generating a counter narrative that this is all politically motivated, that the children are being misled, that *Siachen mein jawan ladd rahein hain* (our soldiers are fighting in Siachen) so why can't these spoilt children give their exams. 

(3) This is just another stratagem, getting  some bhakt professors working at some phoren universities to parrot the government line. You can bet that this will be the dominant narrative on the B&D media throughout the day -- ""the world's basht professors at the world's basht universities are supporting the Modi government"" etc.

There it is, in 1, 2, 3. If you do quick google search you will find -

Do these people know that their names are there on the list of supporters? If so, screw them. They won’t know the reality until someone close to them suffers from corona. Do they think it’s a joke asking people to risk their lives to travel and write exams when there is limited transport, risk in usage of common bathrooms etc. First of all organizing exams is a humongous effort and the staff are at risk as well. Already the covid numbers are skyrocketing and we are not able to bring it under control. Yes it’s going to delay college admissions, mess up academic schedule. but what’s the purpose of writing exams if students have a possibility of dying out of govt’s mismanagement? 

2. I see repeated names on right hand side of the image, are they overlapping images? Is this just another propaganda showing so many names?

3. This sounds like a familiar tale where people are sent out to achieve a goal knowing their lives would be at risk. Hmm, where have I hear this before?

4. Will those academics send their sons / daughters to write these exams in the present condition?"

my56ds,"I'm one of those teenagers with an Instagram account, sharing resources on social media, and the situation is REALLY BAD. I'm working with many groups of people, though my focus is on Tamil Nadu and Delhi. Every single legitimate WhatsApp forward you get? It's probably coming from one of us. We are working day and night, calling hospitals, oxygen suppliers, pharmacies, helpline numbers, blood donors, blood banks and countless other organisations and individuals, verifying every single lead and number, and meticulously organising it into Google Sheets and Linktrees.

The government and most media sources are downplaying the impact. There's a huge shortage of oxygen in many places. Bangalore has an acute shortage of beds and ventilators, Chennai has a huge shortage of Remdesivir, Mumbai has a shortage of oxygen and ventilators: even small towns you've probably never heard of like Vellore, Kumbakonam, Paharpur etc are affected. The underreporting is so evident, it's almost like the government doesn't even want to recognise the existence of it.

Add to this the insane crackdown. I've worked with accounts that have more than hundreds of thousands of followers, ones that have a blue tick on their names, and NONE are being spared. I was reported once yesterday. It's even worse with some of other friends. One in Delhi had the police visit her house and warn them. The government has antagonised teenagers so much so that we are forced to talk to lawyers and law students before doing anything. 

Also, I worked with an account with more than 100k followers to try and help a patient in TN. Despite whatever we did, he passed away. Some battles are lost, but when you are on ground (despite the cover of social media), the scars will take long to go away. I cried for about an hour today. I didn't even know his name.

So, stay home and stay safe guys! Don't leave your house, unless it's absolutely necessary. When you do, mask up and use a sanitiser often. If you are on social media, please try to help accounts by verifying resources, or at the very least amplify them. A tap on retweet or share won't hurt anyone.

Censorship of information and dissent on social media, threats to seize property, apathy to death, scarcity of resources, widespread propaganda—this is indeed war. You see what our problem is: We don't protest enough against the government when necessary. All the citizens who are well informed and educated always protest (if a little) only on social media. That is not enough. For example, consider so many millions of youths in India who are unemployed and are looking for jobs (which are so scarce) have still not protested properly, they have just used social media till now My college whatsapp group was the most inactive group for years. In the last 1 week, we have had 1000+ msgs about people struggling to find Beds or oxygen or meds in Delhi. Harrowing to see this My heart goes out to you and others who have lost loved ones. Every person I know has someone in their immediate circles who is either seriously sick, or dead already. And I'm not exaggerating. Every single one. Two deaths in my extended family already. 


And I'm talking upper middle class people - doctors, lawyers, IAS officers, children of ex high court and supreme court judges. This country has been dragged into shit in a rush. 


I'm afraid of large scale civil unrest, but I am also afraid nothing will happen. Six of our relatives died yesterday. Two were non Covid but to hear such news on almost a daily basis is mind numbing. 
One of the guy was only 30. 
Another lady died alone and cremated by govt officials as both her sons are in hospital. 

I try to avoid social media, try to distract myself with movies but every call from a relative is either a news about being positive or death. 

This collective grief is never ending. How will we ever get over this! I tested positive for it yesterday. I’m so so sorry for your loss <3 Hugs op! All my cousins and their families have gone through covid! 2 deaths so far! Can't believe the numbers being reported! Actual numbers have to be much higher! You're right, everything is hopeless. No one knows how bad things will get in the upcoming years. This is perhaps the worst we'll experience in our lifetimes. Well, that's till the next horrible thing hits us. Chin up my friend, you're here, do everything you can to support your near and dear ones."

It's true and so disturbing, how funny this is. [source ](https://twitter.com/gulf_news/status/1308652568084652037?s=21) It just shows how cocky this government has become, they just don't care about optics anymore. Mainly because their strangle hold on the nation is complete. With the media in pocket and dissent in prisons. Nice .... It reminds the Legend Bala Saheb ... Sharp cartoonist. By the way, migrants data is already published and the the data of the death of farmers is not submitted by states to central. ( Nicely framed argument) And the funnier part is they are asking for people’s Data (Kagaz Dikhao)! xD My take on it ( obviously not claiming any ownership)

[https://imgur.com/a/2NacKrC](https://imgur.com/a/2NacKrC) Its not modiji’s fault. The peacock doesn’t know how to count. It was (and is) really serious, until that peacock popped up. Data is the new oil

It will draw fatwas if that happened, its just twitter outrage here in this case. Well some people do have the habit of making an issue out of nothing!! At first glance I thought this was a lesbian couple, maybe today's proceedings lurking in my mind. But that would be apt too! Pathetic bigots.  Even GOI has admitted in the parliament that there is *no fucking love jihad*. How the fuck has Twitter not banned the verified accts who spread the filmmakers and employees personal details. This is a gross violation of their own policies. And if a white supremacist had behaved like this in America he'd be banned in a nanosecond. I would love to see those hearts if their religions are exchanged. 

Oh. You wouldn't even have the guts to post that coz BLR riot memories go Brrrr... They're shiting on each other....brilliant 🐦💩 I’m very sorry to say this, but: 

One thing is clear we can no longer call India as Unity in Diversity. While there are a few good examples but majority of them are bad. 


Let’s not pretend there’s unity and instead acknowledge the issue. With the acknowledgment, we can at least work on the issue properly IF we want to work on the issue."
h0pymm,"I have read some opinions on various social media platforms that Darren Sammy is making a mountain out of a mole by saying that he was called *Kalu* by his erstwhile teammates. Some justified it by saying that the term *Kalu* or *Kallu* is used among buddies and there is nothing wrong with it. Some are saying that this is not racism. Some are saying that it is not even colorism. I would like to share with them something from my life that is innocuous, friendly and even funny but had far-reaching and damaging consequences on me.

The person who loved me the most was my grandmother. Nobody has loved me more than her. I have many fond memories of hers. I miss her. May her soul rest in peace. But even though I love her and I miss her, there is something that should be said. When I was very small, she used to tease me because of my complexion. She used to tell me that I was dark like a crow and she was white like a swan. She was indeed very fair. I know, children are teased by elders. But a 3-4 years old child did not understand that. I used to get angry when she used to call me *Kalo* (Black in Bengali). I used to scream, ""*Ami kalo naaaaaaaaa*"" (I am not dark). My aunts and uncles laughed seeing me seething in pointless anger. Even though it was not their intention to degrade me, I used to feel that something was wrong with me. Sometimes, I used to take the Ponds powder and pour it on me so that I would not remain dark. My mother, uncles and aunts used to laugh, thinking that I was doing something silly and childish. They did not understand that I was hiding a stigma given by them.

My younger brother, unlike me, had fair skin. I used to feel jealous of him. When I grew up, as a teenager, I never thought of myself of being good-looking. Good-looking were the fair-skin people. The hero and the heroine had fair skin. The villains in the films had dark skin. Dark was bad. An unsaid, untold inferiority complex built itself into me due to the innocuous word *Kalo* that I heard so many times from my grandmother. It prevented me from approaching girls. It prevented me from thinking of myself to be handsome. Getting rid of the inferiority complex took a long time. It is only after I left India that I realized that my color did not matter.

One should not be called *Kalu* or *Kallu* or *Kalo*. The callous usage of such words should be stopped. Even if it is used without the intention of hurting someone, it degrades the person. Such terms are used by ignorant and insensitive people. Even if their intention is harmless, they do a great amount of damage to the people they call such names. There can be no excuse or justification for using such terms.  Even though my grandmother loved me, she was fool enough not to know the damage she was causing to the mind of a small child.",Kalo,Non-Political," This. Exactly. The nicknames we give to people without any malicious intent CAN AlSO CAUSE HARM. Even if we don't think what we are doing is derogatory, we need to understand that the person being targeted may find it so. So many people's confidence has been ruined because of such things. i will believe that the word 'kalu' or similar ones are just good fun and not malicious when someone who has faced the discriminatio all his/ her life tell me that. 

its a classic case of those who never faced discrimination arguing that it doesnt exist. My mum used to sigh that I am a bit dark as a kid. She has no fucking clue how much it hit me until I was old enough to learn better.

She tried the same thing with my kids or any kid for that matter, her first comment would about the skin color, I used to get angry at her and people used to think I am crazy for being unnecessarily hostile towards her comments.

I know how much mental anguish and lack of confidence I had growing up just because I automatically assumed being dark means ugly. I once met a soft-spoken Punjabi guy in Brussels. He was from Jalandhar. He used to do a menial job in a stationery shop. He once expressed his desire to me that he wanted to study in school. I asked him why he did not g to school when he was younger. He said, (and I paraphrase it), ""Paaji, we were two brothers. I was the dark one. My parents were so ashamed of me that they did not send me to school"". 

I had a Punjabi English teacher. She was educated and beautiful but she had dark complexion due to which her mother-in-law taunted her relentlessly and eventually poisoned her so that her worthless son could marry a *Gori Chitti* woman. She survived and many years later when I met her again, she told me about her ordeal. There is no such thing as affectionate racism. Well written and even I have faced this. It had the same impact on me too. As a child, we often do and say things that can be harmful since we are still immature and don't know better. But if we still continue to do those things after growing up and try to justify them, then it is a problem with us. Thank you for this post. As a dark skinned Punjabi girl, I always believed I was not worthy of unconditional love because of my skin. 

As an adult, I'm starting to understand just how deep these wounds are in me. Thank gosh I recognise them now and don't just let them sit in my subconscious. 

All the best OP, keep working on the self-love. have been called kala and had my skin colour reminded a lot. Hurt my self confidence. I so wished that I was born with fairer skin. It hurts. I've grown out of it as an adult. But definitely hurt as a kid and as a teen. It has me thinking OP, shouldn't we also change our standards of beauty? 

Who gets to decide that fair skin is beautiful? Morons on track to ""Most skin cancer from using bleach for having less melanin award""?

It's one thing to be dark skinned in india. It's even worse to have vitligo or even some birthmarks, where people treat the person as an untouchable carrier of contagious disease. It's just skin pigmentation goddamit. 

Stop this bullshit at least in the 21st century.

It has to be taught - at home and school - that we cannot identify people by physical attributes. Or at least that we can stop calling names that can make others feel hurt or bad about themselves. I can narrate a similar story from the opposite side.

I am an Anglo-Indian, and consequently am quite fair, my complexion is lighter than most 'fair' Indians; as a result, I got a lot of unwarranted attention as a kid. Not only from family and parents, from friends, strangers and later, as I became older, girls. 

If I had a dark-skinned friend, my relatives would ask me why are you playing with him, (Coz dark = poor, dirty apparently); when I dated a brown girl, my friends and family asked me why are you dating her, she isn't fair. 

As a kid, my family and friends ingrained in me the idea that I was somehow superior to darker-skinned people; only after I started going to college did I start questioning it; the extra attention started getting on my nerves and I started calling out anyone who compared their or someone else's skin color to mine. 

I live in south India now; and while I am even more out of place as a 'fair' guy; at least here it feels people care a lot less about skin color."

Updates since last time.

WhiteHatJr ORM team gave me death threats on Telegram on Thursday 12th Nov night. I got a DM on telegram giving me threats saying ""***You have no idea what's to come in future when we just move one step forward,... sleep well for today..... we know your location... we won't come for you directly.. but if we want we can come for you tomorrow***"". Although they kept deleting the messages as soon as they were sending, here are the parts of which I was able to take screenshots of.

At this point, the media was acting as if they cant listen to me, they started ignoring my DMs. And this was happening for 15 days already. Things felt really eerie from my end. Almost all the journalists were ignoring this issue. And trust me when I say every publication knows what's going on. I made sure to inform a lot of them. Even got to talk to many of them and in most of the cases, the story got canned by the editor. Byjus is sending them a lot of incentives to not publish about them. One journalist from a reputable publication (which runs of subscriptions and not ads) himself told me that Byjus approached them also and it was shocking for him. And when I asked what happened after that, he also stopped replying. And he knew I was getting such threats shown about for quite some time.

Please don't tell me this and that journalist to contact now, they know and they are ignoring. And the one I talked about above is someone most of you trust, which many of you have suggested me to contact, and some of you also pay for their subscription.

So that night was tough, I had to do something on my own. WhiteHatJr had crossed all the lines already so I also decided to get into the grey zone. The next day I posted videos of their slack channel and started tweeting about them. I have so much against this scam that they can be shut down multiple times now. YET, hardly any journalists have contacted me in the last 5 days. Two journalists did but what's the point if their editors would eventually scrap the articles.

If you want to help, PLEASE DO NOT SUGGEST ME TO CONTACT ANY JOURNALIST, BUT YOU CONTACT THEM, TAG THEM HERE OR TWITTER. But please don't suggest the obvious things. Time constraint is really a bottleneck for me, I have to handle many platforms alone.

FYI, telegram chats are very good for death threats. The other person can delete his chats from your device too (in case you file an FIR against him). It is a feature in Telegram.

So make sure to save screenshots as proof, or login to telegram from a separate device, and cut off internet access for that device (so even if message is deleted by him, message proof is still there in the offline device) Contact the investors.

Jokes aside, file an FIR. I know it seems like you don't have any evidence. However, this is a start. Do you by any chance have screenshot of his contact on Telegram? That can work. This company is a nuisance and needs to be threshed like wheat. Not the people in the company. The company itself. Have forwarded this link to a friend who is senior correspondent in NDTV. Let me see if this gets picked up. Do you have a wiki or single mega link with everything you have so far? Please post an update (or reply to this comment after a few days) to show your safe.

lgtsbu,,"Why are India’s farmers protesting? The government tried to change the decades-old agriculture laws and that’s when the manure hit the fan. If you don’t know, now you know | The Daily Show on Twitter",Politics," He brings out an important point that the structure of the agri sector in the two countries is very different. There is no doubt that small land holdings of farmers is leading to huge inefficiencies, low productivity etc. The ultimate aim of the farm laws seem to me to move towards corporate agriculture. This has taken place in some isolated sectors (e.g. coffee - Tata's Consolidated Coffee has been around since I was in school).

But like demonetisation this is applying a huge shock to the system in order to get there. Someone's getting labeled a foreign agent and will join the FIR club soon Can't wait for John Oliver's in depth stuff. This is great for a summary, but Oliver will have more data, if they're able to or choose to do a segment on this. 

Really wish something like that were done by any Indian comedian/anchor/investigative journalist [YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5mnuCHyYaY&feature=youtu.be) Great, Trevor now, and John Oliver in a few weeks (I am sure it will happen), everyone in the world will know what's wrong with India. There is a video by vox and vice on this topic, has a better visual explanation - video by vox https://youtu.be/iHpZV7ro7lU Trevor!!!!! This was fairly unbaised.

A good thing to note would be that this could be a sort of second agricultural revolution in India, where Bigger Farmers and Corporations take over the smaller farms and the smaller move onto the industrial sector, which is growing rapidly in India as corporations leave China. Bhakts will burn pictures of Trevor Noah tomorrow.. Kindly go into details of the situation. Farm laws are necessary. Farmers from Punjab are being misled. They will get higher prices and MSP is going to stay. Most of other farmers In India are happy with the changes. Uneducated Indian leadership is sacrifising lifeline of 600 million farmers for the benefit of few corporates( who finance them)..

n29zzz,"**I will make an update here to make it more visible.**   


**Update1.** She reached Maharashtra safely, and reached the apartment rented by her friend there. Her family seems to not care that much if she is there on her own, but it's not certain. Her left side of the head is still in some pain, she will go to see the doctor tomorrow. Also seems like her father revoked his kind of guardianship that he had over her in a way, so she is kinda free to do what he wants. She can't return home though, and she is completely fine with that. She will try to recover now and catch up and study skills for the jobs since she has relative peace and no jerks troubling her all day. We will work on ways of getting her our of India. Thank you all for your responses, they really helped to get a perspective on what can be done and how to prepare for the worst. We will check possibilities of some preventive actions to secure her safety and independence. Her family doesn't seem willing to risk it all just to put her in her place, whatever they think it is, or they felt she was a freeloader in their house, and she is gone and they are fine with it. She was not a freeloader though but whatever their twisted wicked logic it can go to hell. Unless they took all the housework she did for granted. Anyways, thank you beautiful people a lot for your advices! I will update if any big thing happens.   


**Read the original message below.**

Hi guys, I need some knowledge and help on how to protect her. Problem is, we are in a long distance relationship - I am not Indian but Ukrainian while she is Indian, so I don't really know how do things work there, neither she is experienced with how to protect her rights that much. Or we are just confused and in shock.

Long story short, today was another day of some regular verbal abuse from her farther and his favourite another daughter. It was occurring for couple of weeks now already since that daughter came to house to visit their father, so she failed to contain it and exploded a bit back. Can't blame her, you sit, mind your own business and some bitch starts calling you a devil, a slut and other pleasant things out of sudden. But then her brother assaulted her in front of everyone, hit her in the head couple of times, started choking her and hitting her head against the floor. Nobody interfered, her father even praised the bloody bastard. Her another sister who tried to protect her got threatened too and couldn't do much. Her 19-old nephew is a pussy though. She got her left jaw broken, bruises, at the moment she has some constant noise in left ear and can't hear properly with it.  She called the police, but the family convinced the cop who came that she is mad, ignored what she had to say about it. Cop concluded that they should send her to a madhouse and they became seriously enthusiastic about it, unless she becomes ""obedient"". Brave cop saves the day indeed. Doesn't matter that there is a an injured girl right in front of you with a possible concussion and her offender right in front of you and he doesn't even deny it!

As for now she escaped the house with her sister that got threatened too and is headed to some apartment she will rent in another state. Her brother set out a watch of some 5 men on the street even, so they waited till they disappeared. Sick, I know.

**My question is,** what can be done to protect her from hers family? You see, hers family is irrational. I don't understand their motives. In the past she tried couple of times to live on her own, but family was not letting her (and then making fun of her that she haven't achieved anything, no job, no house, if it's not a gas lighting, then I am Mahatma Gandhi). So, they hate her, despise her, don't want her, but at the same time don't let her go? What is this wickedness? As you understand, they may search for her. Maybe will write a police complaint. They are also a big and seemingly well-known family in their city or whatever, so they will fear for their reputation a lot, I suppose. What can I do or she do to get safe? Are there some organizations in India who help the victims of the abuse? Can it be brought to the court and how it works? Or should she hide until I figure out how to get her out of India? Can she seek refuge in other countries? Since I am a PhD student in Europe, can I contact its Embassy in India to get some help, or Ukrainian one, since I am a citizen? Maybe local Indian embassy in my current country? I will be immensely grateful for any tips or advice you can provide, guys, it will mean a lot to us both.

Please be safe in such uneasy times.

Here is some more background on her, if you wonder. Could write a big book of what she went through and how she remained human.

>!Anyways, it is as the title says. Her family is extremely abusive. She is the youngest daughter in a family of 11 children. For some unknown reason she got picked up as a beating bag for her brothers, dad or even some of the sisters (survival, don't wanna get beaten, beat somebody else). Abuse was not only physical, it was mental, psychological, gas lighting, you name it, even financial - she was not getting any allowance unlike others, nor new clothes or things, anything. Just because she was rebellious and was trying to protect her mother from the abuse. Sorry for my in love bias, but she is a true gem among that pile of filth. She is 25 y.o. now. You ask why didn't she leave them by this time? She was staying for her mother and looking after her as she got ill and literally paralyzed until she died 2 years ago. We started being a thing just few month before it happened, those were tough times. Once we met each other, we were building plans on how to get together and stuff, but pandemic just crashed everything. All this time she was trying to get some jobs, but one time out of three HR or CEO were literally asking her to marry them instead of getting hired, other two were just simply ignoring. Becoming really independent was not in the realm of possibilities, and also family kept her loaded with insane amount of housework so she didn't have enough time to hone her IT skills. Oh, and should  I mention that they were forcing her to marry some random dudes? She was rejecting all of them, once she simply shaved all her hair and came out to that guy with proposal, he just ran away? Family just called her mad, but ohh the irony, personally I consider THEM mad instead. !<

>!What happened yesterday was the last drop. Things were not physical during the last years, perhaps to not spoil her marriage allure, but everybody seemed to be annoyed with her kindness and not being shit like others. She was getting through the psychological abuse with my help, while was trying to earn some kindness from her family but all was in vain. They were merciless and never appreciated things that she did for them, her sisters called her a slut if she was looking at their husbands (arranged ones) and so on. It can be a whole book and study about the bullshit she went through and I never thought such things exist. !<","EMERGENCY! My girlfriend got beaten and choked by her brother in front of her whole family and nobody interfered but praised him, policeman who came told them to send her to a madhouse, she left the house secretly, any help/tips are appreciated",AskIndia," If she has physical injuries from her abuse , she can show it to the women's commission of the place where she is staying and take her abusers to task. This breaks my heart. I have relatives in India like this, we eventually ceased all contact with them because they are just inhuman.  


My family is originally from India but my father moved our family to Malaysia for work when I was very young. We went back to visit in 2018 and also to get to know our family there. My brother was so shocked on day when he suggested he beat his daughter (my sister) for some small thing she had done. We found out later than my uncle beats his wife and daughter and to use we just could not believe that he could do that. My father was heartbroken that his brother had grown up to be like this.  


When my father was little he remembers his father beating his mother and how he and his brother hated it and promised to fight their dad when they got older. Unfortunately my uncle had become just like their dad.   


My dad had not seen his relatives for a long time and was so excited to visit India and his family. But after seeing how they treat each other and the culture he realized that he had changed, but they had stayed the same and he could no longer accept the way they choose to live.

I pray that you can find a way to save your gf and I also pray that India can learn to treat its women better. Commenting for reach What's her current state i work for govt i might be somewhat helpful ping me Dude you really care for her, thats so sweet idk how these relationships work but maybe you can take her to ukraine ? [deleted] It's India. Even the police have the tendency to protect the family's reputation here rather than provide justice (Don't malign the society or some s***). I speak from experience. Better get them out before it's too late. As far away from her parents and then only can she concentrate in her life. Upvoted for visibility I'd suggest her to make a selfie video and tell about everything her family did to her in past years. Physical abuse, mental abuse and every other thing. Also if she has any wounds or marks that show that she was harmed, show that in the video as well. Then, twitter is your saviour. Tag every possible law enforcement authority around Telangana. Do this only if you're comfortable with going a bit viral. After she gets some support from twitter file required FIRs against her family members and if she can work for a living I'd say Bangalore or Chennai or any part in Kerala would be a great option for her to work until she can fly to where you live. First of all,Both of them(lady & her sis) need to be strong and find a familiar place to stay,someone they know.Trust me it is not safe for both of them to just be absconding in such times,things are not safe here.

I don't think embassies would be of any help here.Can you marry virtually(idk how is that possible) and then ask your embassy for help?

Can you elaborate on her location to be exact?

Different states have their own women's commissions.

Also, depending on her location there might be many mental abuse helplines willing to help. Report it to the Human Rights Commission. They will help her and they are usually faster than the police."
l8tek1,,Bhagat Singhs essay on “Why I am an Atheist” before he was hanged,Politics," Every word this legend wrote is a master piece of humanity's greatest last stance.  Defiant to end, for he believe in the real world rather than a man made imaginary opioid. And sikhs and Hindu nationalists are busy portraying him as one of their own. I remember, years ago, back when I was still religious and believed in god, how I liked his writing a lot, but felt sad because he was an atheist and a Marxist.

Flash forward about ten years or so, and now, I'm at least an atheist. I want to think that, somehow, the reason his atheism stuck out to me and bugged me so much is because I also sort of knew, deep down, that I didn't believe in god, but didn't want to confront that reality in myself. But to do that would be to be a ""little mystical"" for the sake of giving ""the circumstances a poetic turn,"" so I won't, haha. Anyone have a link to the full essay? I’d love to read Bhagat Singh is antinational as per BJP-RSS. Will be arrested for speaking against government and charged with NSA and no bail. Let's see how much he can survive talking against government. It is one thing to garland Bhagat Singh's photo. It is a totally different thing to understand and follow his philosophy. I read the English version of his essay like 2hrs ago after reading this post. Such a brave man to stand up against the ideals of a nation even till the last minute he drew his breath. I want to quote a sentence from his essay which I feel carries a lot of Truth, weight and significance in this day and age. 

""The day we find a great number of men and women with this psychology who cannot devote themselves to anything else than the service of mankind and emancipation of the suffering humanity; that day shall inaugurate the era of liberty."" Anyone know which language did he write this in? Was it English or Punjabi or even Hindi? Very inspiring guy Plus, he was in his early 20s when he wrote this. He is the real punk"

msidur,,Veteran Tamil Comedian Vivek passes away,Culture & Heritage ," Very sad news. Many of his roles used to be about various societal issues of the time and carried subtle social messages disguised as comedy. “yepdi irandhana ipidi ayten” is my fav line of his. He is much more than a comedian, he is a fierce environmentalist who has planted 33 lakh trees via his foundation. RIP The way he says ""Ada paavingala"" always elicit a laugh from me.

Gone too soon, RIP. I loved his comedies. They had a message about the society in general in a very subtle and satirical way. Amazing actor too. RIP sir. Even before I knew any stand up comedians and any comedy sketch shows, this guy's comedy would always elicit a laugh. Very sad news. But also what a privilege to live a life where you have made lakhs of people laugh. Sign of a life well spent. Gone too soon , comedy industry has a void now He will be greatly missed. Apart from being an outstanding comedian on his own (especially his comedic timing that aided many of his pairs with Kovai Sarala, Charles, Dhanush...), he was also a brilliant actor. Loved his work in Vellai Pookal (in which he was cast against type as a detective). His impact on the film industry can't be explained in words, and he was also a great social worker and environmentalist.

He will live on, through his outstanding comedy work, which inspired millions and was singularly responsible (with Vadivelu) of influencing the beginning of Tamil standup. Somewhere in my heart, I feel happy that his idol APJ Abdul Kalam and he have finally reunited. First spb and now vivek. All my childhood idols are passing away. Today the trees of tamilnadu has lost their dad.

Sad day for all of us Damn!"

mmlqfy,,PM Modi’s advice on how to attempt an exam,Politics," Buy the examiner, invigilators, and the question paper setter. Be prepared for everything except the exam itself. Next class: Lata Mangeshkar on how to reverse swing. What a stupid advice.

Attempting difficult question first will not only fuck up your confidence and morale but will also make the checker's first impression that you're a weak student if you make mistakes in it.

Always attempt the easy, if possible lengthy questions first if you are very confident in it. It is very important for your morale to be able to finish the paper with least mistakes and for the checker to know that you know the subject thoroughly in his first impression. This is what happens when an individual opines on a topic he has no idea about. Do the easy questions first

That is the law Kids who are here, do not do that! Our PM is a moron who has probably never appeared in an exam and this whole Exam discussion is a facade. He himself in real life never answers any difficult questions.

Go for the easy one, hit them out of the park and keep all the difficult ones for the end. This was you will at least have confidence straight away and will put you in a mood to answer difficult questions. And, then go home and eat a mango, squeezed or sliced, does not matter. Says the man who hasn't done a single press conference in his time as the Prime Minister of a country. Isn't the actual strategy to attempt easy questions first? Don't attempt the difficult questions, dosti bani rahe My maths teacher told us “If you find any questions difficult, move on to the easier ones. That helps to deal with difficult questions.” He definitely never heard of Fodiji and his great ideas. As someone who cracked IIT, I would suggest not to do this.

Here's the method I used (applicable for MCQ types):
Go through the paper again and again. Do rounds. In the first round answer all those questions you can immediately mark (rate the questions in the round 0).
In the second round attempt the questions which require application of a simple formula.
In the third round, take a crack at questions you think you can solve.
In the fourth round, attempt the difficult ones, and start with the ones which seem strange and new. They are generally easy, you just need to identify what they want you to understand and do.
If time permits, try to solve the difficult ones. You'll find that many of them weren't that difficult. You can't know until you try. 

It is needed that you have studied the entire syllabus properly, because if you don't, you can't even recognise and answer easy questions from the unstudied territory.
And don't get stuck on a question, they're all equally valued (not necessarily but no one's gonna give you a medal, get marks in any way you can)

gspjs3,,Cash counter at Paradise biryani restaurant in Hyderabad. Pic courtesy- Tara Deshpande @Tara_Deshpande,Food," Pro tip for people outside of Hyderabad. Paradise biryani is not as good as the fame it gets. Try Shah Ghouse, Shadab or Cafe Bahar. So that's the secret spice. A nutty brown man. Dude's feeling the heat. Hannibal lector's favourite biryani restaurant. He was demoted from “cook” to “cooked” Is this pic real or fake? Tried looking at pics of the restaurant and can't find it.

Edit : After going down the rabbit hole of trying to find out the actual name of the restaurant/hotel, I've come up emptyless.

I followed all the rules given in the side-bar as much as I could; the title for the picture has been taken from the link I've provided on top, as well as the info quoted below.

I think these pictures are important to remind us what we as Indians ...I’m sorry, what our **Grand and Great-Grandparents** had to live through under the British Raj. The man who is celebrated the world over, to this day, as some kind of a *hero* in the eyes of so many for the way he was able to stand up against the Nazis, and hence protect his country from total annihilation in the second world war--was nothing but a murderer of Indians by the hundreds of thousands, if not millions... once, when the Britishers who were posted in India begged him to send help to save the men, women and children who were dying in the Bengal Famine, as a result of the horrendous policies espoused by this man--all he had to say was, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""it'll be one less Indian to worry about"".

Further reading as appears in the forum in the next comment. I once got into a very heated discussion with a random idiot here on reddit where I started pointing out all the British atrocities and dude was like yeah but the BriTIsh WeRE gOoD toO! Down the line the dude started justifying Jallianwala Bagh and the hanging of Khudiram Bose(16 yr old patriot). Fucking firangis still dont accept that the brit cunts need to pay. Ironic that it's the Japanese. What does your username mean through meth rough you? It's strange that Japan exaggerated British atrocities in India when they brutalized Allied Prisoners of War. Rich coming from the Japanese *Empire.* An Empire which occupied Burma, cutting of rice imports and leading over half a million people to flea into India, and sunk over 100,000 tonnes of merchant shipping in the Bay of Bengal. The British killed more Indian people during WW2 than Hitler killer Jews. It is just that brown lives wasn’t as important as pale skinned people That's not actually propaganda. The British did far far worse things. It is not false though.In bengal they did cut thumbs of tailors woving taant clothes to promote their british clothes from their industrial revolution. This is not actually publicity. The Germans did much worse Horrible truth depicting post"
isiw4g,,"‘I lost a year’: Bihar boy travels 700 kms, misses NEET by 10 minutes",Non-Political," WTF, they must have exempt him and allowed to write the exam . > Santosh Kumar Yadav, a resident of Darbhanga in Bihar, travelled for more than 24 hours and changed two buses to cover a 700-odd kilometre distance to reach Kolkata for his National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). Unfortunately, he was late by 10 minutes. Last time I read something like this, the story [ended in suicide](https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/upsc-candidate-from-kumta-in-karnataka-commits-suicide-after-being-denied-entry-to-exam-hall/articleshow/64460719.cms). We have the misfortune of growing up in one of the most toxic educational systems.

>Varun Chandra, a 28-year-old from Karnataka, committed suicide after being denied entry for arriving late at an UPSC examination centre in New Delhi.

>According to the police, the victim left behind a note in which he cited being upset over his failure to take the exam.

> “There were two examination centres in Paharganj. He probably first reached the wrong centre and by the time he reached his actual exam centre, he was late by a few minutes and was denied entry. He returned to his room and committed suicide by hanging himself."" [removed] That actually sucks bruh At the examination centre, they treat students like they are carrying bomb, weapons etc. That's brutal. That sucks 😓 
I had my UPSC center in Bangalore but I changed it to  Ranchi luckily. If you ever wonder why depression is taking over innocent people, then this is one of the reasons. Adults need to know that a teenager’s problems aren’t a part of hormonal change but society change. This video makes me sab because I can understand how hard the facts has hit the child. some would say : ""if you can't manage how to get to such an important event in time, how can you be a good engineer/doctor"" ? While it's pretty upsetting for the boy infant imagine how competitive this world has become that one year is seen as a huge deal. 

Imagine being in your sixties would it really matter if you did something this year or the next. A year isn't much when we look back is it."

2. Not every country suffered from a big 2nd wave. Countries like Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, South Korea either had a very minor 2nd wave or no 2nd wave at all. US, UK, France, Italy etc are not exactly the gold standard for Covid management.
3. China have a similar population and as of today administered 317 million doses within China (and 240 million doses exported) compared to the 133 million for India and is administering far more per day as well. 
5. There are plenty wrong about India's vaccine procurement. India is not even the top Covid vaccine producing nation now, both the US and China have produced and are producing more vaccine than India now, even the EU should be very close as well. The real question should be how did India go from being the top vaccine producer to the current situation, why didn't the Indian government offer subsidies and secured orders at similar scale as the US or Chinese government so that the companies can scale up production. Why did the Indian government think the current production capacity is adequate? Also earlier last year, a Chinese company invested in BionTech and reached a similar deal with Biontech just like Pfizer (BionTech supplied the mRNA vaccine tech, the Chinese company will do the clinical trial and production just like Pfizer but it'll be for the Chinese, Taiwan and Hong Kong markets), so they hedged their vaccine strategies with several foreign vaccine candidates too. Where's the gif of the ostrich burying it's head in sand Great list! Very informative! Thanks!! I kinda agree and disagree with the sentiment #8. 

If you're gonna blame people, you should've started it from March 2020. Not now. 

I live in a semi urban area(TN) and most people never bothered to wear mask from the beginning. They wore it only when entering hospitals cause you can catch the rona only there right. Even now, if police hadn't fined everyone many wouldn't get one and as expected more than half wear it for the chin or right beneath nose.

Keeping grand functions for religious stuff or marriage and stuff with 100s or even more. 

Not many bothered with the lockdown rules initially too. Video of a traffic police literally begging in the middle of the road to people to stay at home, I think TN people will remember that. 

Plus when govt mentions lockdown, people from Chennai go back home in the last day or two and not many isolate themselves for a week or two or get tested . The Covaxin shit is such a lame excuse. Even if it were to get approved fast, Bharat Biotech has tiny production capacity and wouldn’t have made any real difference"

I have a friend who runs a big youtube channel who need genuine medical content writers adn if you can makes notes on subjects like pharmacology, pathology it will be really beneficial for you while keeping your studies., It won't be much at the start but over the time it will give you results without any effort.,
Dm me if you need more info [deleted] Hi,   
My brother is doing his mbbs(4th year) in Andhra Pradesh. He mentioned one of his friends did duties in nights at the hospital and earned 2000 per night. Apparently he went along with the seniors and did it kind of with their support.  
Do contact your seniors about the same. Sorry for your loss and hope this helps. It is going to be hard. Medical colleges require 8-9 hours of classes. You also need time for self study. Tell me which state are you in right now. 
Check if your father had some insurance or investments in the form of epf, ppf, fd, share or funds. If your father was in any company with more than 20 employees then you can get gratuity. It varies by salary but in general it is one years salary. 
Use them very carefully for now.  



If there is none you can try to procure a loan. Relatives might help but don't count on anything.  
One thing I can suggest is to consult your dean. They might waiver a little fees but not 100%. 

Get your mother a low income certificate(less than 2lakh)saying that she is the sole earner. This can help with fees waiver in government colleges.   
Mbbs will get you loan easily but keep it as a last resort.  

I would have helped but my total income has reduced to 1/4. PM after a month or two in case I get a raise I'll help as much I can 



Edit : (list of scholarships for mbbs)[https://www.thehighereducationreview.com/news/scholarship-for-mbbs-students-in-india-nid-903.html#:~:text=Shamanur%20Shivashankarappa%20Janakalyana%20Trust's%20Scholarship,SHDF%20Scholarships%20and%20JBNSTS%20Scheme] 

Also. I am going to sound casteist but if you are from baniya community then contact local Aggarwal Samaj. They might help you for opening a small time business if you are an aggarwal too.   

If you are in a government college then PM me I'll try to get your fees waived off. If you watch anime, television series, movies, K-Drama or any general entertainment shows then you should try to apply as a copywriter on these sites. Just search ""One Punch Man Season 3"" and send your resume to all the sites you can find. These sites are always on look for writers and some pays good rates of around $2-5 per article. 

I myself run a small site and also have worked as a copywriter for some time. The income is decent and can help you support your family for some time till you land a full-time job.

Edit: In an another comment you mentioned you are from Delhi. Try contacting Spoilerguy, Epicdope, Omnitos and do mention you are from Delhi. Thier owners are from Delhi and I have worked with two of them. You can teach on Unacademy.

There's this YouTube video by Dr. Jagdish Chaturvedi I think, about how to earn money while in MBBS. I am really really sorry for your loss. It is extremely unfortunate and nothing that I say can make it better.

If it's possible by any means, it would serve you better to actually continue your studies and become a doctor. It will most likely help you in securing a better future.

In terms of finances:

- Check if your dad had some life insurance? The payouts can help.
- Was your dad employed by some organization? Check with them if they provided their employees with insurance or have some programs to cover them in case of this scenario.
- Speak with your college about your situation. They might be able to waive off your fees for a year or two.
- I know its extremely difficult but maybe your mom has some skills that can be transferred to a job? If she prefers being a house wife then maybe dabba service, food delivery? I understand it won't be enough but if insurance and fee waiver works out, it might help in making ends meet till you become a doctor. I’m not sure if a strangers condolences over reddit will offer you any measure of comfort whatsoever. But I’m still very sorry for your loss.
As for jobs, Is Zomato or swiggy an option? Also, please don’t take this the wrong way, but which city do you live in? If you are in Karnataka, maybe I can help find something. You are an MBBS student, that means youre surely strong in your academics. Ill suggest to look for becoming a private tutor. Specifically for 11-12th class students. There is a high demand in market for those, given that everything has shifted to online mode untill foreseeable future. Ask your relatives/friends to spread a word. Use your social media to advertise that youre looking for this work. And advertise your scores in those competitive exams too. Please don't leave mbbs for job. 

Please dm details, will figure something out"

In the end when it's over and lakhs would be dead he'll be all over the media claiming victory over corona .

Makes me want to throw up

If this is real india, then I don't owe a single fuck to this nation and would look only for my own.",It's really sickening how the PM has refused to even acknowledge there's a disaster going on and has virtually been silent on the matter,Politics," Classic Modi, never associate with negative press no matter how dire the situation is, and if he has to it must be one way communication like man ki baat or stupid speech with superfluous shit and nothing concrete and straight up lies. BJP dogs like sambit patra , gaurav Bhatia , these foul mouth brutes will tackle it by shouting and name calling whatever remaining press is in the country. Nazi born scum fucks. Classic PR management. Modi doesn't want to associate himself with the Corona crisis. Because he will then have to acknowledge the problem and be held accountable . Not that he isn't responsible now. Thats his regular strategy . Keep quite until the problem goes away. That moron cant even give a single press conference unscripted even when country is going through worst crisis ever....everything good happening is coz of him if something goes wrong he wont even acknowledge or takes blame complete moron India lost itself in 2014, when we brought these unscrupulous ideologues to power, under the guise of a new era. Surely all the negative press reaches the ears and eyes of these people who are in power. Then too they act indifferent.

Its not like this disaster started yesterday and people are calling for their heads today. Its been well and truly a month since the carnage started and yet they're trying to only protect their image.

Supreme Leader is just a manifestation of all this callousness that was building up inside the people in the last 80 years. Why do you think he has been silent? He has milked the situation very well. By liberalizing vaccines and letting private players vaccinate for money, they’ve endured enormous profits for hospital chains, SII and BB. I think they are not even covering the deaths that are happening in BJP ruled states like Karnataka for ex. No wonder why other south indian states TN and KL hate those shameless losers He's not silent, he's at a gurudwara Imo what are channels like NDTV doing? If I was them I’d put an empty window at 9:30 with the PM name below to highlight his absence. Some channels in the UK did this during the height of the pandemic. It’s ridiculous how no one is asking them for an explanation on why Delhi is getting half of its oxygen requirements. [Kya kya kaha tha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7p5kDtH-mc)?

njt0f3,"Does anyone really know about everything that's going on in Lakshadweep now?

The little island off the coast is one of the most beautiful places I have been to, but administrative injustices have served the citizens a taste of bad fortune. Ever since the sudden death of Dineshwar Sharma, the former Administrator of Lakshadweep, and the Modi Government's appointment of Praful Khoda Patel as his successor, it has been one problem after another for the people of Lakshadweep.

First, the Administrator arrived there with little care for COVID guidelines. He scrapped many of the rules they had in place to avoid the virus, and now they have to deal with the pandemic just like any other state. 

One of his first moves was to stop schools from serving non vegetarian food in their canteens, and in a predominantly Muslim community, this was extremely unfair. Why change what isn't broken?

His administration then destroyed many sheds and local institutions that were set up to help the fishing community of Lakshadweep. Then, for a city that has a very little number of vehicles, he wants to widen the roads and bring down several houses that are in the way.

Praful K Patel even went on to enforce the Gunda Act. On an island. The police stations of Lakshadweep have very little crime to deal with and the jails are empty, then why do we need the Gunda Act? The Gunda Act is the administration's answer to put those who oppose their decisions behind bars.

As if this wasn't enough, the administration then went on to dismiss several employees at various Government institutions, including healthcare, agriculture and education, even removing those who cook food and teach sports at their schools, without proper cause or reason.

These are only few of the things that have gone wrong in Lakshadweep. What are we going to about this? Do we turn a blind eye because there is so much going on in the world? Or do we step back and take notice. And much must be said about the Government in Power. What goes on behind the minds of people who are taking a moment such as this, when the whole world is already suffering, and make people suffer even more. Enough is enough.

on another note 

**2019 Election Officer Coercion**

On 10 April 2019 Election Commission of India issued a notice to Prafu K Patel stating that his actions violated provisions under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The commission reprimanded Patel for having issued a ""coercive"" request to Kannan Gopinathan, the collector for Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and withdraw any notices issued to Gopinathan or any other election officials ""during the election period."" Election Commission Officials state that Praful Patel called election officers to issue them direct instructions. Crucial interference from Patel came after Gopinath sent a notice to Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar for actions that violated the model code. Praful Patel retaliated by issuing a notice to Gopinath which Election Commission Officials described as an act of political vengeance.[7] Since then, Kannan Gopinathan has been replaced with Sandeep Kumar Singh as collector.

**2019 Daman Indigenous Land Clearing Protests**

Valuable seafront land along the 700 metre stretch from Moti Daman Lighthouse to Jampore beach is claimed to be owned by adivasi fishing communities who have lived there for generations as well as by NRI Damanese predominantly living in Leicester, UK. In December 2018, local residents received official looking documents purportedly instructed by Praful Patel ordering the confiscation of their land and demolition of homes to make way for development.[8] In January 2019 Praful Patel hosted a hastily arranged meeting with British MP Keith Vaz but managed to allay his fears about the case.[9] However, by November the bulldozing went ahead and the Daman protests began.

On 3 November 2019, Daman Collector Rakesh Minhas issued a Section 144 order banning peaceful assembly of four or more persons, slogan-shouting and the use of loudspeakers across the entire district and ordered the conversion of two High Schools into 'temporary jails'.[10] 70 protesters were held in these 'temporary jails' and another 8 arrests were made.[11] Few of the adivasi fisherfolk were rehoused whilst most languished traumatised and homeless on the streets near the rubble of their razed homes.[12] As of March 2021 the site is now billionaire Binod Chaudhary of CG Corp Global's The Fern Seaside Luxurious Tent Resort offering tourist accommodation for $80US/£57GBP/6000 rupees for night in a tent.[13]

**2021 suicide of Mohan Delkar**

Tribal rights advocate and Lok Sabha MP Mohanbhai Sanjibhai Delkar hanged himself at Hotel Sea Green in Mumbai on 22 February 2021 leaving a 15 page suicide note.[14] The note held politicians and administrative officials responsible for ""injustice"", ""insult"" and ""bias"" meted out to him and specifically named Praful Patel.[15]

On 5 July 2020, Delkar had posted a video on Twitter threatening to resign as Lok Sabha MP because the local administration was ""hounding him"". Then on 19 September in parliament he raised the issue of ""misbehaviour"" by local officials ""as part of a conspiracy"" claiming that on Liberation Day (2 August), he was ""denied the right to address the people of the region as an MP"".[16]

First Information Report (FIR) under Section 306 (abetment of suicide), 389 (Putting person in fear of accusation of offence, in order to commit extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 was filed against Praful Patel, Daman Collector Sandeep Kumar Singh, former police superintendent Sharad Darade, and few politicians including BJP leader Fatehsinh V Chauhan; who has a history of land grabbing disputes.[17] Delkar's son Abhinav has alleged that Patel threatened Delkar to pay ₹25 crore (US$3.5 million) or he would be implicated under PASA Act.[18]

**Save Lakshadweep Campaign - 2021**

Following the appointment of Praful Patel as the Administrator of Lakshadweep, a campaign against the new administrator's policies gained momentum. On 24th May 2021, #SaveLakshadweep became a trending hashtag in Twitter India.

The official twitter handle of Kerala Students Union - the Kerala wing of NSUI was suspended for a tweet against Praful Patel on 23rd May 2021[19]. The campaign was mostly against the new administrations plans to deregulate alcohol and ban beef slaughter on the island. A majority of Lakshadweep's natives belongs to the Muslim community. It was claimed by locals that the administration was implementing Hindutva agendas. There were other controversies regarding demolition of fishing structures and proposal of a new rule that prohibited parents of more than two, from contesting in local elections. >One of his first moves was to stop schools from serving non vegetarian food in their canteens, and in a predominantly Muslim community, this was extremely unfair. Why change what isn't broken?

He is fucking with their way of life in all manners possible. I am pretty sure that fat clown fuck wants to sell off Lakshadweep to those two businessmen

God please save this country from those greedy motherfockers. Is there anything that we can do to save it from happening? I just checked after reading and its actually scary. Idk what to say we are already facing a lot of issues in the country due to poor governance and their attitude. i fucking hate the idea of 'union territory'. It basically means the local people dont get a say in what happens to them. Some guy Dehli sends gets to do whatever he wants. 

This is fucking insane. Give all union territories statehood, and let them elect their local leaders who will care for them. Why is alcohol being made legal there? If the community doesn't want that then why force such laws to hurt their sentiments? 

Now before you point out that laws of india apply to lakshadweep too, let me remind you that alcohol is banned in gujarat - where this Pariful Patel comes from"

""The phenomenon is popularly known as the 22-degree halo because the ring has a radius of approximately 22 degrees around the sun or moon.  
  
A 22-degree halo is an optical phenomenon that belongs to the family of ice-crystal halos. The halo of the sun or occasionally the Moon (also called a moon ring or winter halo), occurs when the sun’s or moon’s rays get deflected/ refracted through the hexagonal ice crystals present in cirrus clouds. These clouds contain millions of tiny ice crystals, which refract, split, and even reflect the light to give an impression of a circular rainbow ring. The crystals have to be oriented and positioned just so with respect to your eye, in order for the halo to appear."" Cortana : Chief, our next mission has arrived. At what time was this?

jd70o9,,"A commemorative USSR stamp from 1984 featuring Bhaskara-I, Bhaskara-II and Aryabhata satellites",Science/Technology," Aryabhata, the first satellite built by India, was launched on April 19, in the year 1975. Aryabhata was built by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to conduct experiments in X-ray astronomy, aeronomics, and solar physics. The spacecraft was a 26-sided polygon with a diametre of 1.4 metre. 

The 360-kilogram satellite built by ISRO was launched by Russia from their Kapustin Yar rocket launch and development site using a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle. The agreement between India and the Soviet Union directed by U.R. Rao in 1972 allowed the USSR to use Indian ports for tracking ships and launching vessels as a token for launching Indian satellites.

The satellite had its data receiving centre in Bangalore, where a toilet was converted to serve the purpose.

To commemorate the event, both India and Russia released commemorative stamps. Our stamp. ₹2 coin for scale of course. How did you get this? Is there a way to buy online?

jwwq5q,"It was not one job per se, but a project to earn Rs. 5000 in 7 days.

Year was 2002, and Nokia 3310 was the rage. I was 2500 kms away from home, in Mangalore, just after my 12th for MSc.. Parents gifted me 3310, and well, I lost it.

A local bully made me a friend, then one day asked for my mobile for a few hours, as he claimed he was going to meet his girlfriend. I gave him the charger as well, in case.. And the next day he flew to Dubai.

I could have told my parents and they would have sent another one, but I took it personally. I cannot break their trust.

I decided to earn Rs 5000 in 7 days and buy another 3310, and since the entire hostel and college were empty for Diwali vacations, I had to do it on my own.

There is this Laxmi College there, and hotel management guys conducted annual Diwali party, with Rs 200 odd entry ticket. DJ, food, dance and booze. The guy from the organizing team told me to sell one booklet of tickets, and get Rs 300 as commission. And one ticket free.

I sold 10 booklets, that is 100 tickets. I went from shop to shop, on foot, pitching the party to youngsters and the uncles. They bought it happily.

Then I worked as an ice-cream seller at a big fare which was happening in the middle of the city. Some Rs 200 for 5 hours of work. Sold some 100 ice creams, and got Rs 100 extra too.

Then I joined an ODC team.. Which is Outdoor Catering Service. A huge party at a seaside resort near Suratkal was happening, and one good soul took me in. Unlimited food and Rs 500 per day was promised. Served food wearing a uniform, greeted the guests and escorted them out when the party was over.

Records tell that I made more than Rs 5000 that week, and bought a new phone. It was a Samsung model with bright colors and funky music.

Wanted to share because reading yours reminded me of those days. OP shouting roadside : Food, booze and DJ with girls!!!

m5xf3h,"In the previous post, **we already debunked the fake news that UP rose from #5 to #2** in state GSDP  and that in the last 1 year UP, jumped ahead of Karnataka & Gujarat.     

--------------------   
   
Ajay has also made more fake claims.   

Here is a report about his speech & the fake claims he makes in them - [UP will become India's largest economy after BJP comes to power in 2022 polls, says Yogi](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/up-will-become-indias-largest-economy-after-bjp-comes-to-power-in-2022-polls-says-yogi/articleshow/81326628.cms)

**Fake Claim 1**    
> The CM said the GDP of the state was Rs 10.90 lakh crore in 2015-16 (when the state was being run by the Samajwadi Party government) which has grown to Rs 21.73 lakh crore in four years. It has increased more than twice in four years     

- First of all, 2015-16 to 2020-21 is **5 Years** not 4 years. Unless it's some Vedic Math I am not familiar with.    

- Also even if 5 years, it hasn't really doubled. In 2015-16, UP's GSDP was 11.37 Lakh crores. In 2020-21, it's supposed to be 19.4 Lakh crores. That's a 70% increase - much, much less than doubling.   

- 70% increase in 5 years, works out to a **11.26%** increase per year CAGR. West Bengal's 2020-21 GSDP is not yet available. But in 4 years (2015-16 to 2019-20), **West Bengal** grew at **11.98%** CAGR - i.e grew faster than Uttar Pradesh. If you compare 2015-16 to 2019-20 only, West Bengal grew at **11.98%** CAGR while UP grew at **12.06%** - Ajay had practically the same growth as what several BJP supporters consider the worst performing economy in the whole wide world.  

**Fake Claim 2**   
> He said the per capita income in 2015-16, when the SP was in power, was Rs 43,000, which has now increased to Rs 95,000.    

That UP's per capita income has grown to 95,000 is probably a big lie.   

In 2019-20, as per RBI data, UP's per capita income (current prices) was Rs. 70,419. RBI hasn't published 2020-21's data yet, but a jump from 70,000 to 95,000 in 1 year is unimaginable.  

Also we can try to roughly calculate it. UP's GSDP on current prices for 2020-21 is 19.4 Lakh Crores. Assuming UP's population is the same in 2020-21 as it was the previous year, then that works out to a per-capita GDP of around 76,000 Rs, a far cry from Ajay's claim of 95,000. Also, the denominator has surely increased in one year, so it's probably even lesser than 76,000.   

Again, even in the growth in per capita figures, West Bengal did better than UP. RBI has published Net Per Capita figures upto 2019-20   

- At Current price, **Uttar Pradesh** has grown **49.5%** from 2015-16 to 2019-20.  
  **West Bengal** has grown **52.3%** in the same period.  

- At Constant price, **Uttar Pradesh** has grown **23.5%** from 2015-16 to 2019-20.  
  **West Bengal** has grown **25.3%** in the same period.

Thank you to serLundry for linking me to Ajay's speech in the previous post comments.",More lies from UP CM Ajay Bisht about UP growth debunked,Politics," Jhooth Bolo, Baar baar jhooth bolo.. Need more posts in this matter , I want to share it with some of ajay beasts supporters . 

Even if I can convince one of them , It would be nice UP was number 2 in the latest ease of doing business rank. Government needs to try to sell UP as an investment destination. If you ever pass Chowpatty, you will have seen massive ads with yogi's face on them asking people to come invest in UP. I saw the name and for a second I thought, who is this guy and why is he CM of UP. Then I realised it's Yogi's real name. This is the link to my previous post where we debunked the articles which said that UP has gone from #5 to #2 in state GSDP - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ly1thj/unable_to_make_sense_of_the_data_used_in_the_ajay/ Awesome analysis this. In the right hands, information is BJP’s kryptonite. In the right hands. there are lies, bad lies and then there are reports. god knows who make these reports. how do they collect data, where do they collect it from. they publish this nonsense somewhere and appropriate parties take advantage of that crap! no one knows the genuineness of the data. Stirring up religious violence, empowering police and Hindu goons, fudging data to fool idiots into thinking there's an economic boom. 

Where have we heard this story before? 🤔 Great analysis. I think what is happening here is they are prepping up Yogi to be the next PM/Dictator. That said I’m not sure if he has the same pull as Modi does. It might backfire. Thank you for doing what you do. However we are powerless against RSS-BJP's well oiled propaganda machine. Have seen this before with the Gujarat Model^TM I like that you refer to him as Ajay Bisht. Print media should at least refer to him by his real name. He uses his title 'Yogi' as a veil to display religious grandeur and infallibility."

This sting hurts & disheartens. This is terrible. My heart breaks for the little baby. No one should die like that. Poor poor child. We are going backwards now. People who are wondering why the caste identities matter, you're either ridiculously ignorant or just malicious assholes, yet are causing the same kinda harm. Someone's religious, caste, economic class matters when it comes to crimes in the subcontinent. It matters because upper castes have been doing this for millenia and going unpunished. In rural, tribal areas rapes, harassment, molestation of lower caste women is ridiculously common and perpetrators get away, the entire administration facilitates that because they're upper caste. Hatras victim's body was burnt at midnight to shield the UC rapists. Fuck off with that caste doesn't exist bullshit. Hope this is interpreted to fall under the 'rarest of rare' criteria by the courts. This is so abhorrent. The perpetrators must be prosecuted to the full extent of law. Raped?

If he contracts it, he will go off radar (under the clouds) and we would't know. He makes public appearances as and when he likes (later lockdowns weren't announced by him, no press conferences). So we wouldn't know if he has contracted it. He will definitely recover because our best health infra will be devoted to him. Is it possible that he got it from Modi.

Modi was with Amit Shah couple of days before Amit Shah got it, and he should have been in self isolation. He should immediately take Coronil and other things prescribed by his party members for developing immunity./s If I was Modi I'd be a bit nervous rn I am sure that Modi is getting tested every day.

guisxu,"Hi Everyone. I trust you all are doing well in the lock down (or no lockdown.... whatever) 

I finally swallowed the bitter pill and embarked on domestic air travel yesterday. It is like pulling a wax strip off your body. But I have finally done it. These are my experiences. 

I needed to travel to my in-laws place in Andhra Pradesh, which has been long overdue. Obtained the necessary travel pass from state government web portal, booked tickets. They mentioned on the pass that atleast 7 days of institutional quarantine would be required till I'm tested negative twice, which is cool. 

31/05  15:00pm - Delhi Airport. Disinfectant sprayed on the bags, contact less ID verification at the main entrance. Print the boarding pass from kiosk, check-in baggage and I was good to go. Everything looked so seamless. 

31/05 16:30pm - We got face shield, hand sanitizer sachets and face mask provided by airlines in a simple kit. It was cool again. Things looked sorted, process-wise. They also asked us to fill and submit a basic information form physically along with necessary declarations. I filled it online in Air India website already. Still A ok. 

31/05 17:00pm - Boarding starts. They called seat no. wise. Looked very organised again, avoided crowding at the aircraft entry point. Crew were rocking full PPE. They were absolutely sensitive to passengers agony as everyone was wearing a face shield and a mask on a hot summer afternoon. Water bottles offered with out contact. Take off on time. 

31/05 19.30pm - Landed at Vijayawada. Uncle sitting g next to me was teary eyed, as he has come back to hometown. Tol me he stepped out of his house after 2 months of almost zero human interaction. All happy. 

31/05 20.00pm - Medical Kiosk at the airport. Temperature check, symptoms check, full another form and you are good to go. 

31/05 20.30pm - Police kiosk outside the exit gate. Another time, information was taken along with boarding pass details. The cop told us we are being segregated based on which district we are headed. 4 separate buses waiting outside. They collected a Rs. 150/- ticket to get into the bus, which was strange. I was going to guntur district. 

31/05 21.00pm - Got informed that we are headed towards Guntur primary testing centre, which is 40kms away. Sounded ok. There was one diabetic lady in the bus who was restless already. There were no shops open at the airport. May be it was past closing time. Someone in the bus was kind enough to offer her some biscuits, she calmed down. 

31/05 21.30pm - Policeman gets on the bus, assures us we are in good hands. May be slightly delayed , but pls bear with us. As soon as we a reach, there would be nice dinner and later testing would be done. Once procedure is over, we can head to paid quarantines available in Guntur, they are available at various price points. Everything is taken care of. He also reassured that we may not need 7 days as medical teams are on top of testing in the state. We never saw him again. 

31/05 22.30pm - Bus has not moved. Folks are getting baked inside the hot bus. There is legitimate risk in sitting there for so long. I was wearing a fucking wind cheater which was causing so much perspiration. But hey, we need to take some for the society. We see a new set of policeman and traffic police SUVs for escorting the 4 buses. 

31/05 23.30pm - Bus has not moved yet. Apparently they were waiting for another flight to arrive. People are absolutely hungry and agitated now. 

01/06 12.00am - Bus finally moved. But as passengers familiar with the town noted, we were not heading to Guntur town. 

01/06 01.00am - We finally arrive at a college hostel which is being used as govt quarantine center. There were some people put up there already. There were 2 constables waiting to receive us. And 2 supervisors at the quarantine center. Passengers were agitated. They wanted food. We got down and headed inside expecting dinner. Cops were surprised when we asked for dinner. They said who asks for dinner at 1am!  There are rooms for us there. They were handing out disposable bedsheets. I went in and got my name registered. They gave me a room on 5th floor. This building did not have a lift. Quickly went up and checked. It was a poorly ventilated room with  nothing inside. Hard cement floor and some bedsheets for us to sleep on and common washrooms! 

This was turning into a horror show. There were kids as young as 3 years old to 60 year old. The cops tell us they have no instructions apart from not letting us get away with out testing. Supervisor was already annoyed that he had to stay up late for us. Angry passengers demanding him food - he did not know what to say. 

01/06 1.30am - People already staying there came out of their rooms and told us this is a pathetic place and don't get stuck in this shithole. Loud and clear. They did not care the the cops were standing right there. Most of the people wanted paid quarantine anyway. 
There was one hindi speaking gentleman from Rohini in the group who looked 50+. He was totally confused as he did not understand the language. I was the only one who could converse in his language. He kept checking with me what was happening. I later found out that he was a project director at Amaravati (new state capital) for a large construction company. There was one family Indian-American family with US passports who were probably living their worst nightmare. A couple with 2 little girls who were drained out after crying for so long. 

01/06 2.00am - The entire group got to talking and discussed. We decided that the only solution here is to mobilize some higher authority and convince them to take us to paid quarantines. Just a reminder that these cops had no idea what happens in the airport.  They only met us at quarantine center. 

01/06 2.30am - We convinced the cops to call  their boss and seek help. His boss was not happy when she got the call and had to wake up  at night. She quickly gave a hotel name 'X'. We were supposed to reach there. They took a head count. Oh my god the counting, they would count every fricking 15 mins. That was their only priority - ensure that nobody runs away. Some people in the group told it is one of the reliable hotels in town. It has been there for generations. We got reassured. Looked like the misery is finally over. 

01/06 3.00am - At hotel X. Main entrance - there was only 1 security who had no idea. The place has been shut down since 25th March by police order. Lol. One security and one house keeping/maintenance guy is all they had. It was clear that nothing can materialise there. 

01/06 03.15am - Embarked on wild goose chase in Guntur town, 3 buses ( we were sitting one person every row), 1 police escort vehicle (to ensure nobody runs away) searching for accommodation. Irony is, we were passing by homes of few people sitting inside the bus. It was Pulp Fiction unfolding. 

01/06 03.40am - Reached another hotel. Tough luck. Quest continues. At this point I felt bad for the 2 cops who were bearing the brunt of a bunch of hungry and frustrated group of people and had no solution to offer. 

01/06 4.00am - Another hotel with rooms available. Holy cow, what a delight. 20 people out of the group can be accommodated here. As the hotel guy noted, they were not expecting us. So not every room was ready to be given out and housekeeping staff would only show up in the morning. Old people and families with kids got allotted first. I managed to grab a room for myself. 

01/06 04.30am - Got into my room. It was freaking disgusting. It was not cleaned up after the last guy left. Did some basic cleaning myself. Being a wise guy that I am(yeyy...), carried my own bedsheet, towel toiletries. Settled down but could not sleep as I was feeling hungry and weak. 

01/06 8.00am - I got to have breakfast. Felt like Jon Snow after the Long Night. 

01/06 11.00am - Swab test by medical team who came down to the hotel. 

There may have been lot of things that went wrong in the colossal shit show - lack of co-ordination between district police departments, not enough resources dedicated, may be they don't care or there may be other priority jobs to take care of for the government mechanism. I have no mental energy to think about that. Posting this so that others who are taking up domestic travel are aware of the ground reality. It may be different in each state. 

Finally, my heart goes out to migrant workers who have been enduring even worse nightmares for weeks and months now. If one horrible day can leave scars, imagine what it can do to a person's dignity for extended period of time. 

Hope I don't get into trouble for posting this. I have 2 tracking apps running on my phone - Indian govt app and state govt app. 

Sorry for a long & absorbing post. Stay safe everyone. The outside world is a tough place right now.","I travelled on Domestic flight yesterday. These are my experiences, so far.",Unverified," Bloody hell, that was one heck of an ordeal OP. Looks like if we can stay comfortable where we are, we shouldn't move. After reading your ordeal, decided that taking a trip, unless absolutely mandatory is not recommended. Had us in the first half not gonna lie My sister travelled from Mumbai to Kochi 3 days back. She booked a window seat and an extra middle seat to keep the distance. After landing, took a prepaid taxi which had a partition between the driver and the passenger and disposable seat covers. We got a call from the district hospital and the local police confirming her arrival and asking whether we had a separate room and toilet in the house. The next day a team from the hospital including a staff nurse came to our house and confirmed the same and advised us to call them back in case she developed any symptoms of COVID. Also got a call from COVID state control cell confirming her arrival and quarantine. The experience here in Kerala seems better and hassle free. 14 day home quarantine if asymptomatic at landing. So they made sure people skipped their lunch and dinner to maximise their chances of catching any virus due to weakness? Feeling sad for the diabetic lady. That’s why they say that the “memory of an event is far more powerful than the haphazard event itself”.

Brilliantly written. Me in the first half - Damn, such competency

Me in the second half - oh yeah, nvm Thanks for this and thanks for mentioning the migrant workers before someone could jump on you about it. You took a great risk by making us aware of the ground realities. Hope your two tests are negative soon and you are reunited with your in laws.

Good luck !!!! Can someone suggest me a good book? I rarely read books, but after reading this entire thing i feel like reading.

PS: Nice writing OP. I travelled from Bangalore to Kochi by flight today morning. In Kochi Airport, there was temperature checking and they noted down the Pass number.

Got 3 calls from Local Health department after I reached home asking about my health and family. Overall great experience. Institutional quarantine CANNOT be managed by the govt, plain and simple. There may be a success story or two but by and large, to have the kind of efficiency to pull of a sustained institutional quarantine is beyond both centra/state govts. 

Also, I really think this subreddit ignores what goes on South Indian states. The covid crisis has really set apart Kerala and TN from the other 3. Time we ask questions of KR, TS and AP too. What a shitshow. I would be more worried about the possibility of getting covid19 from quarantine efforts like these. 

Instead of this why don't we have testing centres for passengers before the flight? Only people who test negative for covid19 are allowed to travel. This government is reopening the economy without thinking about the logistical challenges facing the economy. I mean how long before there are no hotels available to quarantine to."

Raja raja chola of southern Chola kingdom had 10000 elephants in his army. No wonder he conquered all the way to the UP. Imagine going to war with an endless wall of elephants walking towards you. Man the country was fucking rich This armor is currently at the royal armouries in Leeds

https://collections.royalarmouries.org/object/rac-object-1761.html It's funny how rapidly  technology has advanced

All this armor is nothing in front of a cheap gun used by poachers. That's fascinating. There's a really good podcast called ""Yuddha"" that's narrated by two cool blokes from the Takshashila Institute (the modern think tank, not THAT Takshashila). Their first episode is about the war elephant and its role in Indias military history, specifically in the context of Rajadhiraja Chola and the Battle of Koppam. Really cool podcast overall, worth a listen to anyone who's interested in the military part of Indian history. Whoa :o Poor animal Anti national elephant, supporting the Muslim!!!

And our people are also no less gawar. They choose freedom over safety. One of my neighbours has never put mask till date in Covid, I wonder how she is still alive. I am a Public Health graduate and back in October 2019, two of my friends and I met our Public Health professor from graduation days. We started discussing the pandemic potential of covid and how it can easily spread all over the world soon. I was joking to her that since it spreads a lot between people who are social and go out a lot, I am safe. The thing is that if a person like me with close to no experience in Public Health knew about the potential of this disease months before it wreaked havoc, I'm pretty sure many other scientists knew about this and must have warned the respective governments. This is the price you pay for ignoring the scientific community. A lot of the world's governments reacted with absolute arrogance towards this. Literally, the only country that handled it well and did what it had to do was China and people shit on them for some paranoid conspiracy theories. That name tho i take offense at ""there isn't enough literature""

k9555s,,Peaceful protest by Satish Acharya,Politics," Adani,Ambani &other corporates had an eye on massive food grain market of India.They had few problems:

Problem 1 :
States had different rules &regulations 2buy food grains frm farmers. It was difficult 4corporates 2handle so many states with so many different regulations &taxes

Modi Solution:
Took control from states and made 1 act for whole country. Corporates happy now.

Problem 2:
Corporates will buy crops and store them. But Essential Commodity act will stop them for storing crops for long time, as it increase prices in market.

Modi Solution:
Food crops will not come under Essential Commodity act and can be stored for longer period. Corporates again happy.

Problem 3
It was hard to determine that what type of crop will be grown by farmers.

Modi Solution:
Contract farming for farmers where they will be told by corporates to grow what kind of crop. Corporates again happy.

Problem 4 :

How Corporates will handle court cases if anything goes wrong against farmers.

Modi Solution:
Farmers can not go to courts. They will go to SDM and DC.
Corporates again happy as they can bribe them easily

They say bills are in favor of farmers. ....

n1nl1g,,He is Dr. AK Roy currently serving at district hospital maharajganj up he is crying because he don't have remdesivir to save the people's life 💔,Unverified," This is really bad time for honest people who want to do their job, but can't.

And they know people are dying & there is nothing they can about it. My heart goes out to all these doctors and other healthcare workers. They see so much emotional trauma everyday at work, and all we do is criticize them in a fit It is really a tough time for the doctors and nurses who choose this profession to save lives. Just to put it out- Remdesivir isn’t a life saving drug. Hasn't shown response in many and isn’t really required unless there is high viral load, which it decreases to an extent and hence might shorten hospital stay. Same goes for Plasma. It is not included in treatment guidelines, and it’s use is off-label. 

https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-recommends-against-the-use-of-remdesivir-in-covid-19-patients

Please do not scramble and panic looking for it.
Steroids and Oxygen are the main line of management in moderate to severe cases. Timely identification of individuals who need these is more important than procuring a drug with limited evidence.
Anticoagulants are useful is certain cases.

Edit- Prevention is far better and easier than landing in this trouble. Get vaccinated and keep your masks up!

mzggf5,"I'm really sorry to say this, but you guys still don't get it. Our right wing facist governments actions is finally affecting you, and only now you think they've done a bad job? Guess what, you're nothing but selfish!  

When demonisation happened, you didn't empathise with those who suffered unfairly.  
When farmers protested, you thought you knew farming industry better than them. 
When CAA and NRC protests happened, you just thought they're anti-national troublemaking Muslims.  
When Muslims were getting beaten up or jailed on the mere suspicion of transporting beef or befriending Hindus of the opposite sex, you either called it stray events or you thought they deserved it.  
And please, we all know what Modi did in 2002, there is no point in pretending otherwise. The reality is you didn't care enough about it (or maybe you actively supported it).  

This government has never truly cared for all people properly. If you haven't seen this until now, you lack serious empathy. 

This country isn't gonna develop anytime soon. Maybe enough people have got pissed off with covid handling now, but BJP or someone else will always be there to divide people and take advantage of their fears, ignorance and hatred.",Message to all BJP voters who think they've woken up to the horrors of BJP,Policy/Economy," > The reality is you didn't care enough about it (or maybe you actively supported it).  

rightly said. people are going against the government only becaue they are being directly affected by the government. they have always considered muslims as outsiders. even if you would talk to them today, they would agree not to vote for BJP but will call muslims outsiders or someone as a traitor for leaving hinduism. they will actively support muslim genocide whenever that has to happen. these cunts don't even leave their own kids. kindergarden students in my school were calling themselves proud bhakts and were cussing muslim classmates. fuck them. fuck their existence. they have been taught that our freedom fighters including ambedkar were asking for hindu rashtra and muslims and chrisitians are our enemies. i have met people who actively supported delhi riots and wanted muslims to leave the city, one of the reasons was ""muslim men are harassers and rape hindu women"". my english teacher always used to put stories of muslim men criminals, totally ignoring her own nephew who was beaten up for stalking a girl Bhakts have different ways to cope with cognitive dissonance. I've known people who have suffered a lot during this pandemic and their family member who have died due to lack of adequate healthcare. 

Despite all this, they have been making up arguments in their head to deflect blame from Modi. They're truly disgusting individuals beyond all repair. Will be actively disassociating myself with such people. Not only do they lack empathy, they are so blinded by hate that even a tragedy that the government has inflicted on them did not make them mend their ways. Can never trust such people. Agree with the sentiment. Those criticising the BJP now for this failed management of the pandemic are just as likely to turn away again tomorrow when normal service resumes and hateful rhetoric and bigoted policy proposals are shoved through.  
  
But as a counter-point just consider that there is very rarely a single ""Aha!"" moment when people completely change their opinion on something. It's almost always a gradual process and the result of an accumulation of factors which makes them change their mind. So, while they might not have said anything or withdrawn their support after demonetisation, CAA, Article 370, agriculture bills, Ram Mandir, etc, those issues might still have played a role at the back of their mind when coming to the decision today in the light of this devastating second wave to disavow the BJP and condemn its governance.  
  
Things build up and there are many who have been quiet spectators (as opposed to enthusiastic cheerleaders) while the BJP has run roughshod over our democracy. It's taken something that hits very close to home to provoke their response but that doesn't necessarily mean they were fully onboard with whatever was going on prior. Perhaps this latest disaster has given them occasion to reassess how they viewed those previous actions and have made them realise that they were in fact several steps in the creep towards incompetent totalitarian rule and ought not to have been ignored.  
  
Of course, I don't believe this outrage against BJP will sustain in most of these people. All it takes is for Rahul Gandhi to say something which the IT cell can latch onto and they will be back on the Modi bandwagon. But there is always going to be a straw that breaks the camel's back and the breaking point for each will be different. For some it was demonetisation, for others it was the implementation of GST/farm bills, and now a few more will open their eyes in light of this latest disaster. And they still don't learn. People are literally dying on the streets but Kumbh Mela is going on. 

The Australians in the IPL have more conscience than some of our so called ""leaders"". And when the lockdown is absolutely required because of mismanagement, our dear leader knows it will be death knell of his support among migrants if instituted. So the coward has asked the state governments to do it so he can come back and blame them in the next round of elections.

Hoping the comment doesn't get censored or my property seized. First they came for the Kashmiris, and I did not speak out—  
     Because I was not a Kashmiri.

Then they came for the muslims, and I did not speak out—  
     Because I was not a Muslim.

Then they came for the migrants, and I did not speak out—  
     Because I was not a migrant.

Then they came for the soldiers, and I did not speak out—  
     Because I was not a soldier.

Then they came for the Farmers, and I did not speak out—  
     Because I was not a Farmer.

Then they(Covid) came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me. Yo OP aren't you a bit too optimistic? I bet all the brain-dead BJP supporters are still supporting that sack of shit in the PMO. While some fence sitters are criticising the govt, the hard core Bhakts are still enamoured by Modi. 

In fact they are saying that they feel safe that Modi ruled during Covid instead of RaGa RSS ideology is divide and rule. I have my friends in college too who joined RSS in their first years of college and outrightly deny equal rights for Muslims. They were not like this before listening to RSS agendas and talks.

But one thing I would like to mention, our religion is secular in most aspects. If other religions had a majority in India the scenario would be totally different. Probably like Pakistan. Peoples opinions are gonna keep changing. Political affiliations will also keep changing. People who supported BJP then might not support them now, who knows 10yrs down the line the same people will again vote for BJP? 

I remember back in 2012-13, the Congress govt was churning out scam after scam and at that time it truly felt like the BJP govt was gonna bring in sort of a revolution. I was a kid then, but I could see how people had that hope. Present day it's kind of the opposite now. The people who supported them are slowly turning against them, and I really really hope more people realise how badly they've handled the covid situation along with everything else. 

That said, there's no guarantee that they'll feel differently about all this in another decade. That's just how it is. Do not forget, Link your aadhaar atrocities by chaddichandan gang. It’s about time bhakts realize they are nothing but useful idiots for this government. Sooner the better."

nidfu5,,Proof that Ayurveda does not work for real diseases!,Science/Technology," I almost died from COVID because of my parents who blindly believe in Ayurveda. They kept administering some concoctions and I was too zoned out to resist. My oxygen level had dropped to 84. Thankfully, a relative intervened when he got to know of my status and the magic potions I was being given. He took me to the doctor against my parent’s will. He could do it because he is the elder one in the family (Indian things). Mind you I was nearly passed out from low oxygen all the while this was happening. The doctor I was taken to gave me steroids and put me on a concentrator. I immediately started recovering and was at 97 a week later.

But because of all the delay I likely have some permanent lung damage. I’m so mad at my parents that their ignorance and blind faith has caused damage that will stay with me for a long time to come. I used to run 10km without any issues and now I’m exhausted after walking even 2km.

It maddens me that the government is promoting alternate medicine in the middle of the pandemic. Please don’t risk your or anyone else’s life following Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Yunani or any other system of medicine.

I can’t even tell you how mad I am at my folks. Reminds me of a joke from comedian Surendra Sharma.

ramdev's pic is from 2011

https://www.indiatoday.in/india/photo/baba-ramdev-ends-nine-day-old-fast-against-black-money-365667-2011-06-12/9 Don't get why these guys even represent ayurveda.. they are just businessmen and nothing else Who's the person in first pic? I guess second one is Ramdev right? Look at this libral doctors not allowing ramdev to take coronil ayurveda. As I see it, ayurveda is no longer a branch of science, but it's wrong to claim it never was. 

I believe in it's early stages, it was developed through experimentation and observation of the effects of plant and animal products on sick individuals. Ever seen anyone apply turmeric on a wound? It is a natural antiseptic and the curcumin present in it can reduce inflammation. Ever had fennel seeds to help soothe stomach pain? It is an antispasmodic. People observed this hundreds of years ago, and documented it. That's ayurveda.

Now, most of the bacteria, viruses, etc. that affect human beings have mutated and have grown resistant to most of these natural remedies. Also, the diseases themselves have become more complicated than could have possibly been comprehended, let alone cured by people with no real medical technology. 

The MAIN issue right now is people who promote ayurveda as an alternative to allopathy. Allopathy uses similar scientific techniques of experimentation and observation, but with hundreds of years worth of science backing them up and access to remarkable technology. The right thing to do would be to accept the limits of Ayurveda, appreciate the enthusiasm and scientific thinking of the people who lived before us and move on. Just my two cents. Are these real? No problem with Ayurveda or Ayush... Let there be a transparent, peer reviewed paper about each and every drug that has been and is used. Let the various methodologies be widely dissected, studied and put in the public domain and equally let their be papers about the mechanism of actions of each drug and mode of treatment. Until then, it's just a grandmother's home remedy. I will just leave this video here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HslUzw35mc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HslUzw35mc)

This is the absolute best Youtube channel imo. I don't think Ramdev will ever accept facts and truth! Because if he does, he will have to close his shop!!"
j8hb9k,,Cannabis is no more dangerous than alcohol or tobacco - Today's Bangalore times.,Non-Political," This article appearing on a national newspaper alone means a lot in the context of progress of drugs in India. Cannabis is actually *safer* than alcohol/tobacco Cc : Arnab Goswami, Bihar police, BJP uncles This article mentions psychedelics like LSD as ""hard"" drugs which should stay illegal. This is at odds with  science, which shows psychedelics have immense potential in **curing** anxiety and depression. 

No existing medicine is able to cure these mental health disorders, only manage them. [30-50% of all people with depression do not respond to the currently available medicines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK261988/).

This is why a psychedelic, [Psilocybin, has been granted ""breakthrough therapy"" status by US FDA](https://www.livescience.com/psilocybin-depression-breakthrough-therapy.html) for treatment-resistant depression and a [UK company is already running trials](https://www.bloombergquint.com/amp/business/-magic-mushroom-company-moves-toward-mainstream-in-nasdaq-ipo).

Most mind-blowing sidenote ever: [Psychedelics are expanding our knowledge of human  consciousness](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/what-psychedelic-mushrooms-are-teaching-us-about-human-consciousness).

Even [MDMA (ecstasy) has demonstrated therapeutic potential](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/comment/mdma-ptsd-treatment/) in treating PTSD. What are the odds that people in 2060 or something would be laughing at this? With this government, they'll ban alcohol and tobacco before they remove ban on cannabis Finally some one said it.
This is SFW USA being an asshole, screwed us and now it's getting legalised there. 

While we can only dream of it ever getting legalised again. not true, tobacco is more dangerous It is THC not TCH, correct me if I’m wrong(?)
Mentioned under - “Overdose” column.

Alas, I doubt they’ll legalise it - the way it is portrayed, be it in media or within our society. It will be amazing in terms of growth/revenue to our nation if legalised. So the article title is to get the reader's eye on the article, but if the article is actually read it promotes marijuana and conveys that it is less harmful than tobacco and alcohol.

I wish the article title would convey what the article says. 

I've smoked tobacco and marijuana and I prefer marijuana more than tobacco. India followed US banning the use of marijuana due the pressure US was putting on India. Before than Indian government used to sell marijuana.

But now the US is trying to legalize marijuana and certain state have already legalized it, why does India not follow them now. 

Think of the profits companies would be making. But I think it would take a lot of time for India to legalize it as there are lots of bad people making profits out of the illegalization than they would make of the legalization of it. Cause there would be more competition.

Indian weed is considered high quality weed around the world. There is a documentary of this guy from Europe coming to India just to get some weed seed so that he can grow it in Europe.

Edit: I got the title wrong and I agree with the title."

I am not against Ayurveda  but such claims should be stopped before even we know they tested for it and  what if there sample size is less than hundred  pr even less than 50 . I guess most people know that our body is capable of curing the virus itself , just some people need oxygenation and ventilator care , otherwise proper nutrition and hydration is enough for most people. stay home stay safe Bilkul ricks nahi lene ka Ramdev fooled Chowkidar."

Great strategy. Na koi ghusa tha.. Na koi ghusa hai.. tldr; As Coronavirus cases spike in Lucknow, testing facilities in the city have been constrained with private diagnostic laboratories not conducting tests or restricting their sample collection. Dr Lal Path-Labs and SRL Diagnostics claim they have not been collecting samples for COVID-19 testing for nearly 10 days, citing orders from administration to ""not conduct tests"". Others like RML Mehrotra Pathology said they have stopped sample collection at centres and are only testing samples collected from hospitals.

*Summary generated by [sansa](https://sansa.news/)* This is straight forward admission, saying we have failed. Last two months I used to see lots of paid advertisement on UP development in news channels during prime time. 

I mean this is sad. There must be some explanation for taking such a tough decisions... In the holy words of Dolundjee Trumpjee ""if you don't test you don't have cases"" Can't spell Fucked up without UP. This is the way. When Trump said this we laughed. Little did we know we would end up in the same fate. This is enough to shoot your BP up. This is the price we pay to live in a society. A society of scrupulous, illiterate idiots. Maybe that's why Aristotle said, ""The one who lives without a society is either a God or a beast"".

it9nro,,"Govt: No Data Available On Migrant Deaths During Lockdown, So No Compensation (OC) Cartoon",Politics," It is the lack of data. Nehru didn't build a statistical Institute. /s This is a great response from this govt, I was expecting them to come out with a ""No migrant deaths"" agenda... -	Investigate Love Jihad
-	Investigate cow slaughter 
-	Arrest students and activists based on their names
-	Arrest dissenters
-	Plant pseudos to take down state governments 
-	Vilify citizens through paid media
-	Get a incompetent police force to write 11L page chargesheet 
-	Count used condoms in JNU


But when asked questions:

-	we have no data on migrant movement and subsequent deaths

-	no actionable input on drug trafficking between film industry and mafia

-	PMCARES is a private fund. Hum kagaaz nahi dikhayenge 


Kya 2 kaudi ki sarkaar hai bc [deleted] State governments with maximum Migrant influx such as Punjab, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Delhi should have had all data and passed on to the Central Government and claimed compensation from it.

Unfortunately, neither was bothered much then. Situation was crazy and is still crazy.

But logically speaking, all migrants moving by government means, such as buses, trains, aircrafts, the data would be available with the concerned state and central departments but the unfortunate ones moving by foot and other means of their own, I really have no idea how a tab would have been kept on them. 

I talked to worker a few days back who came from Delhi to Jharkhand. He told that many of them were dropped till UP border and they ferried through UP buses till Bihar border. Some stayed back in UP as state government was providing shelter and food. Some moved on to their journeys to Bengal and Jharkhand by foot. He and a friend of him came to Jharkhand on a truck. The Jharkhand Government was providing food all over the highways. He ll be going back to Delhi in a few days. The contractor he works for is paying for his airfare. Our honorable home minister said in parliament they were able to identify the perpetrators of NE Delhi riots using facial recognition software from the cctv footage(The very same tech used by the fascist Chinese government to crackdown on hongkong protestors*) and now the same Indian government says they don't have data on migrant deaths.It's not about giving compensation for the government, it is actually the amount of embarrassment they would face when the numbers are revealed.

*Thanks for pointing out the correction u/InfiKnight97 What do you mean Migrant Deaths? Are you Desh Drohi? We have got bhavya ram mandir now. Migrants don't want compensation. They wanted Ram Mandir and a big ass statue Another Masterstroke. 

There can not be any deaths if you don't count them. 

No deaths = No compensation. 

Waah Modi Ji Waah. Any major news channel discussing this in prime time ? It's like 4D chess move you know, If you don't keep track of Migrants death so no point of compensation...

Only Gujrati Businessman can think such pro move... Can't milk PSU's anymore so just sell them... Don't find anything to attract eyeballs so why not grow a beard or feed Peacock.. If I don't name China, people will never know who grabbed 1000 sq. Km of land at boundary... Obviously there's no data. The government was busy collecting/analysing data for : 

- Muslim population by 2050
- Calculating the number of zeros in 5 trillion economy
- Number of stones with ""Ram"" written on it used to build the bridge from India to Sri Lanka
- Number of Chinese apps they can ban so they get bragging rights on Monday night RAW
- Correlation of any minor protest to Kashmiri pandits
- Number of Subjects they can tackle by just blaming Nehru/Pappu government
- Calculating the number of times modiji used ""mitron"" in his mann ki baat ( researchers say that it is exactly the number of times you should consume gau mutra a day)
- Calculating how many litres of gau mutra a cow can produce under BJP regime vs Congress
- Calculating how much is owed to Arnab
- Price of Onions in a non-Onion eating household (kya he faraq padta hai)"

To get him a bed we had to call around 4-5 people. Even ministers themselves weren't able to get beds for themselves or their family members. It is getting really serious. We also had to buy overpriced medicines. **Modiji took us to the front page of one of the world's most popular Newspapers. What else do you _chamchas_ want?** This picture is going to sear itself into my mind for as long as I live. Man, those pics of burning pyres creep me out. Undoubtedly, there is massive under-reporting, which seems to be the result of a deliberate cover-up. Waah re Fodiji, waah! Respect. Did any indian newspapers run this news on front page? Modi is seemingly doing a Khmer Rouge in India and calling it the glorious establishment of some Hindu Saudi Arabia.

No matter how you slice it, the people of the world are getting ever closer to extirpation, with Indians at the very forefront. For some reason after looking at the picture, I’m reminded of the meme that was circulating in my family WhatsApp group just days before the 2019 elections. Press the BJP button on the EVM and a bullet comes out of the EVM shooting a Muslim looking dude. The caption was : One vote, one terrorist dead. 

And now looking at these pyres, I’m just very very saddened. Never ever look forward to anyone’s death just because you have been brainwashed or follow a foolish ideology. You never know when the tide will turn against you. >In Surat, an industrial city in Gujarat, the grills used to burn bodies have been operating so relentlessly that the iron on some has actually melted. On April 14, Covid-19 crematories in Surat and another district, Gandhi Nagar, told The Times that they cremated 124 people, on a day when the authorities said 73 had died of Covid-19 in the entire state.

Damn... Also check front page of financial review, an australian newspaper. looks like war scene Stalingrad or something"

You learn about the existence of IITs. You get into coaching. You make new friends. You fall inlove.You tell her. She likes you. The summer goes well. JEE coaching starts. A new stream of smartstudents comes in. You feel intimidated. You are motivated to study more.

You're slightly disappointed but you choose to get admitted in an IIT anyway.You feel overwhelmed by all your peers and activities. You make a few choices. You don't wantto miss out. You make new friends.

You barely manage your acads. You wonder what's important. You meet more people. You fall inlove again. You try to learn a lot of new skills. You miss home. Somehow you manage tocomplete your first year. You come back home and spend the summer with your family.

You take more classes, you choose various electives. You can never focus in class. You hateyour egoistic professors. You start studying only for the exams. You look at your peers and feelleft out. You learn more skills - machine learning, management, coding. You take more PoRs,intern at a couple of places. You wonder if it's really for you. You try recreational activities. You'readdicted.

You see your love interest with someone, you don't even want to confess. You reject yourself.You put up a fight just to get the minimum credits. You try to get your career together. You get rid of youraddictions. You don't succumb to self-doubt. You focus on your health, relationships and skills.You start improving yourself. You succeed to some extent.

You have a well paying job. You somehow meet your first love again, she's married to the loveof her life. You feel bittersweet about the situation. You work your way up the corporate ladder.You get promoted. You switch to a better company. You work hard for people to click on moreads. You buy a car. You're at a position where people would call you successful.

You work for a few more years and decide to get married. You marry a girl you found throughmatrimonial sites. You have a stable relationship. You both decide to buy a house and raise achild.

You are financially stable to afford a good lifestyle for your family. You don't get enough time tospend with your family. You go shopping every once in a while. You buy gifts for your kid frequently.

>Yes, those are fictional stories too, and they may or may not be consuming/using those products. Aamir’s character too is imaginary, even though PhonePe is real, juxtaposing the real and unreal just like WhiteHat Jr.

Point to note is that that celebrities are required to do due diligence under the ASCI guidelines when they endorse a product and open themselves to liability if they indulge in false or misleading advertising. So, its not free for all even in that case. This was a very interesting read. Finally, I learnt the origins of Wolf Gupta.

Good Times we're living in. Maybe he's not as dumb/useless as our media makes him out to be.
Sure, he's made his share of gaffes in interviews but i guess if modiji did unscripted interviews toh entertainment wahan bhi ho jata. I had joked with a friend once in 2015(one year into Mudi raaj) that we need a Batman, Rahul Gandhi could be a Batman. That time we guys had such a low opinion of RG (yup, I was one of the teenage turds who called him Pappu), that it was satire. I realise now how our opinion was simply influenced by the widespread ridicule of Rahul Gandhi by media outlets for a few minor stupidities that he had done, and that we had no actual real reason to call him an idiot, except that everyone was. We were the real idiots, hands down. We never realised that he was simply a gentle guy, and that no human is perfect. We made him out to be a nepotistic piece of trash. We vilified him just for being born with privilege. I have never been more ashamed about my past self. We ridiculed a man, who, despite being a politician, helped a rape victim's family and did NOT want any fame for it. This single bit of information changes a lot. I was wrong. We don't need aggressive, oversmart leaders with outstanding oratory skills and  big fat promises, and fucking acche din. No. We first need a person who is kind at heart. I'm not saying that I want an overwhelming absolute majority of Congress. Nope. That shit is toxic. The best government would be a coalition. But we sure as hell don't need BJP in power. Joke's on me now; Rahul Gandhi actually turned out to be the dark knight. We were the real Pappus. I literally can't believe the U-turn being done in the public image of Modi and Rahul.

After seeing Rahul Gandhi's last few interviews, my opinion of him changed and I realized he's actually pretty smart for most people to understand. And now considering how Modiji is handling our country, I dream of the day we actually have a kind and smart person as the PM (Either Kejriwal or even Rahul). I miss the press conferences and a real democracy. I don't follow politics at all but I always used to think Rahul Gandhi is an idiot because everyone made fun of him and called him 'Papu', but looking at stuff like this really changed my views on him and I gotta appreciate him doing good things like this despite being mocked by the whole country Wholesome boi Maybe he's not so bad afterall"

nc4tf1,,1981 postage stamp issued by Government of India in solidarity with the people of Palestine.,Foreign Relations," As the country at the forefront of the war against colonialism, we had been very clear that we stood with the people of Palestine, whose land had been colonised in the worst way: settler colonialism, in an age supposedly marking the end of colonialism.

Both Nehru and Gandhi, having seen the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from what is now Israel in 1948, were pro-Palestine.

When the UN proposed the Palestine Partition Plan (giving more than half of Palestine to the \~30% population of Jews, most of whom whom had hardly lived there for 50 years) India voted against it, the memory of religious violence and displacement brought by Partition still fresh on our minds.

We also didn't have diplomatic relations with Israel until 1992 tbh i feel bad for both israel and palestine people i mean israel is under rocket attack and Palestine people home are taken away and for some reason indian twitter is trending support for israel like why would you support taking of people home i guess this is the situation indian kashmir Indian government was funded by Islamist countries back then and was antinational.

/s Ideally, India should remain neutral and refrain from the 'Abki Baar trump sarkar' type gaffe. We receive a lot of help from Israel and it is also one of our strongest allies against the aggressions of China and Pakistan. It also supported our Nuclear projects and has supported our cause in the UN. On the flip side, India as a secular state and a democracy(at least officially lol) should have good relation with Palestinians. Yaser Arafat was also friendly towards India and so was India. Basically, be in the centre for once and jump into murky wartime politics, but who am I kidding Modiji ka Kuch bhorosa nehi I'm sorry, but if you're someone who keeps their mouth shut when the Army goes and terrorizes Kashmiris and you believe and repeat all the nationalistic bullshit about J&K in the papers, please don't say a single fucking word about Palestine. 

When article 370 happened and people were protesting, literally every journalist in India (except Arfa Khanum), literally every bhand from bollywood, literally every social media personality, literally every politician of every party, was completely silent about the existence of the protests. A whole lot of people that are blind to the plight of Kashmir are now coming up on social media and talking about Palestine. They're just copying western media like a nakalchi bandar with zero critical thought. How the fuck are you an ally of Palestinians when you have a Palestine in your own backyard?

Similar thing happened with Black Lives Matter. People who don't give 2 shits about dalits, who treat lower caste/lower income Indians with utter disrespect, who use words like Bh*ngi, were suddenly all retweeting #BLM. Such hypocrisy. Nehru categorically rejected the Partition plan as another Imperialist fiddling given India's own event of partition, And given India's forefront nature in anti imperialism and colonialism , The reasons where well justified , given India and Cuba where the only non muslim countries which voted against the resolution.
But the realpolitik was to , quell India's own muslim population and maintain relations with the Arab states and its own muslim neighbours ,along with the whole before mentioned cause .
Coming to the modern times ,power equations have changed as individuals we can mourn the destruction that is happening in Palestine but as a nation can be afford to lose the cooperation of Israel ?. We can clearly see who the winner is , should it be warranted that we ,who have a precarious situation in world politics now, intervene on behalf of people, forsaken by their own arab brethren. I got my first passport at the age of 8 in 1988. It was valid everywhere apart from South Africa and Israel. Both were considered apartheid states. People of Palestine must be saved from Israel as well as Hamas. It is unfortunate that some Indians today are sympathizing with the Israeli state and government machinery over Palestinians who are being killed and maimed at the whim of the Israeli state, or who suffer institutionalised discrimination and restrictions on their movements within their homeland. I fear that some Hindutva nationalists are blindly supportive of Israel out of a bigoted hatred of Muslims and Arabs.

The situation is presented as a complex issue, but it is very simple: the most powerful country in the Middle East with a bloated military and a blank check from the United States and other Western governments practices a form of supremacism within Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. Israel routinely engages in brutality, and is even in violation of international law by expanding settlements in the West Bank and violently displacing Palestinians from their own homes to make way for Israelis. 

I hope all right thinking people see the facts of the ground and come out in support of the Palestinian people. It is a point of pride that India long supported Palestinian rights and aspirations! Choosing either of the sides blindly is really dumb. The issue is much more complex and is much more than ""This good, this bad"". The land have had a complex history with mistakes from both sides. I will recommend a video from Vox, to  have some better understanding of the matter:

Let’s call a spade a spade; BJP and the media are islamophoes and anything they say regarding “Muslims” should be questioned/analyzed to remove the inherited bias of hatred they will try to instill. Really pathetic that instead of questioning authorities and politicians as to why Kumbh was permitted...Indian NEWS channels are running headlines like ""Astha ki dupki"", I don't know what made Indian media so worthless so quickly There’s also an ad running on history tv18 calling people to attend with pictures of Modi and Uttarakhand CM But bro they have taken covid test brooooooo When confronted with this, everyone I’ve seen resorts to the argument that Tablighi Jamaat also happened and what not. I’m honestly fed up of this form of argument where you justify your present actions with incidents of the past. Religious gatherings are bad during the pandemic, no matter what religion. No one but Rahul Gandhi and Congress is to be blamed for this. Shameless Hindu appeasement."
mw0y0x,"Modi's and BJP's game is up.

The video of Modi boasting about the size of crowd in his Bengal rally is the equivalent of Rahul Gandhi's interview to Arnab. This is where the 2024 election will be lost

Most senior members in my family and relatives are Modi bhakts (Non bong community in Calcutta) who have supported him on everything including DeMo and GST, even when it had a direct negative impact on their own business.

But the last 1 week has changed their opinion. They don't really care that the government had no plan or foresight to tackle this ( my dad said that everyone is responsible for that, just with varying degrees of blame). However, what they cannot accept that the country's PM was more interested in winning an election in WB than trying to pro-actively manage the biggest crisis seen in this country since ages.

They have finally realized that their 'God' is just a deeply flawed human.

P.S - This is anecdotal, but I have been hearing similar stories from other people. Also, one of my uncles who is a RSS member claims that RSS, which generally has an ear to the ground, is super pissed off with Modi.",This will be the downfall of Modi and BJP,Unverified," Tell this to people in Goa, Karnataka and MP.

They would simply buy MPs from other parties including Congress. Lol. Ram mandir will be ready by that time I hate to break this to you, but more people will die due to this asshol before people understand he is the devil. Forget it. Elections are 2-3 years away. By then all this will be forgotten. There will be no viable opposition to remind the junta of this ineptitude we are going through. Modi will prevail with his formula of religion, nationalism and division. And don’t forget, the Ram Mandir is timed to be completed around then. Nope. You want to know how foolish these chutiya bhakhts are ? 
There is a page on facebook by the name *Veerangana*  (written in first english, then hyphen, then written in hindi then 🔥🇮🇳).

Join the page, pretend to be a Bjp supprted and then just watch a week what kind of posts are shared and what logic they give for such posts. I was obvsly kicked out when I couldnt take more and lashed out in one of the posts. As long as modia exist, it won't be.

Attack godi media and modi is gone. I hope so but we have a very little attention span... Maybe if the elections were next year or so but 2 years down the line everything will be forgotten My father has probably been voting for BJP all his life (a very reasonable guess though his philosophy is to keep voting decisions to himself so doesn't share) but he is just really pissed about Modi still holding elections. For the first time ever, he spontaneously displayed deep dismay about Modi's behaviour. So you aren't alone. RSS will find a suitable replacement for Modi Oh you sweet summer child. You live in a dream world. The only thing that matters to the people who put the BJP in power is mandir kahan banega. They will not be swayed by this. I think you might be right in the long-term. Yuval Noah Harrari said all reactionary (religious or ethnic) movements ultimately fail in the long-term because they are unable to bring the economic growth and human development growth people expect. Eventually they burn out.

Recent statistics coming out of North Africa showing a collapse in support for Islamic political parties which had previously peaked in support during the 2000s/2010s may prove this. I think BJP still has a shot at the next election, especially since the opposition is so scattered and weak. But if the economy continues to remain this stagnant and low then the BJP's pro-growth propaganda and divide and conquer communalism will reach its limit."

>Though the BJP had publicly claimed that they will win 10-20 seats, many leaders had told TNM that Amit Shah had instructed that the party should win at least four seats this time. But the BJP has been unable to do so and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s words that the BJP’s account will be closed in Kerala have come true. In my experience Kerala is such an integrated society that BJPs message of hate would be pretty alien everywhere except perhaps Kasargod.

Keep voting against demagogues Kerala I hope this translates to all over the country in next lok sabha elections. Bjpee won a seat last time at the cost of congress. They fielded a weak candidate against bjp to see the left candidate lose. But this time a bjp strongman K. Muraleedharan himself was an M.P contested against bjp. Congress got their votes and left won this time.

News and media from Kerala gives unwanted attention and representation on T.V and the bjpee guys are always blabbering shit on T.V. Next whole country. This is just the beginning of the end TN did a good thing too. I’ve never been a big fan of the Karunanidhi clan - But maybe Stalin might be different. It’s a wait and see. He’s also making comments that he’ll have no lockdowns etc. he’s not making sense either. A bit sad. But let’s see. Let’s be optimistic. tldr; The BJP has failed to win a single seat in the Kerala Assembly election and has been unable to retain its only seat of Nemom, which it had won in 2016. The party's state President K Surendran lost from two seats, including Konni (Pathanamthitta) and Manjeshwar (Kasargod), both of which he lost. Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan had said that the BJP's account will be closed in the state.

I'll feed more kids one day I'll surpass him. Will remove Poverty and Hunger from India one day. 💪💪 He who saves a life saves the world. Why aren't Indians holding their government responsible for feeding children? This man is doing great job. But I think its not others duty/job to feed someone's child people should think before bringing a baby to the this world, if you can't provide food and shelter to your child you don't have rights to have a baby. He should also distribute condoms to people. This should be posted on other sub-reddits as well Mam he looks like a papa bear too. So good Kudos to this man.

Intially I'm sure the outrage & the giggles were too many, but his focus on these topics must have helped many folks, undoubtedly. My newspaper reading interests were at an all time high, thanks to him. I'd say, many, many were regular readers because of him. Not only did we learn something, we also enjoyed his saracastic wordings in the answer.

Once, a guy asked if he could eat honey, ice cream off of his wife's vagina, the doc replied, 'Why just stop there? Prepare pani puri, masala puri, add spices to it and eat to your heart content' not verbatim, gist of it. These made the reading so worthwile.

Om Shanthi doc Watch ""Ask the Sexpert"" on Netflix.. It's a great tribute to Dr. Mahinder Watsa.

RIP.. One last nut in the name of lord Vatsa! I remember how i used to hide and read his section on Mumbai Mirror as a 12 year old, good old days :')

Rest easy Doc. Rest in peace.

Anecdote: One morning during rush hour on the Borivali fast, I was reading the Mumbai Mirror headlines, hanging from the handrails in the doorway. A fellow hanging on the opposite side of the door asked me if I could pull out the page with Watsa's column and pass it across so he could read the questions and answers of the day WTF! Now who will answer my questions? Rest In Peace.
It's a serious moment pardon me but maybe it was the universe's way that he was a sexpert and died at ""96"" tldr; Dr Mahinder Singh Watsa's children have released a statement on his father's death on the 12th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. The statement read, ""The man that was Dr Mahinder is no more. He has been replaced by a man who is a man of the world."" The statement added, ""We are proud to have him as our father.""

And in the end when reality hits the sheep, they just remember the leader and not the nation he said he will make great > They would much rather see India collapse in an ocean of cremation pyres before anything happens to their precious party. 

I was stalking the other sub( you know which one ) and there was a post that was criticial of BJP. The top comment said something to the effect of ""It is getting tougher and tougher to defend BJP"". It was interesting to read that comment because clearly a lot of supporters are in a constant defense mode. Instead of criticizing their 'own' for their shortcomings and push them to be better, they had rather just defend even the most indefensible acts. If BJP were their kid, it would grow up to be a spoilt brat lol. bad parenting 101. 

Plenty of other comments were ripping BJP a new asshole though. So yeah, I guess BJP supporters exist all across the spectrum. one day mudi kaka will betray them too , even then they will blame opposition For them Modi is papa and papa galat nahi ho saktay and they always find someone else to blame They don't love the nation, they just hate minorities Most of the comments are fairly skeptical and while I can understand them - they are not factual. 

I think people can accept contracting the virus. 

People won't accept their neighbors and friends and family not getting a hospital bed and oxygen. No matter how much of a bhakt one is. Propaganda machines will spin it to show how supreme leaders diplomacy has worked, no one cares jach shit about that anymore.

I have my friends and family who are hardcore BJPee supporters turn against them. No one of them have are personally affected but they have seen what's happening. 

Heads must roll for this. Big Time. True. According to bhakts, thousands of people dying is not a problem but criticizing BJP for it is. What this pandemic and climate change crisis taught me - 
#Some people aren’t concerned about the truth. They just want to be right all the time. They just want to win the argument 

I debated with BJP IT cells, Trump supporters regarding climate change. These guys just want to be right. You give them proof they just wouldn’t care. Give them 1000 articles that proves climate change, they will deny it by one or two articles they found in the internet that support their claims. Same thing happened with the pandemic. They want to be right all the time and wouldn’t mind jeopardising and sabotaging innocent lives. I no longer debate with these people to show them they are wrong. I just debate to educate others so they wouldn’t get misguided. I met a bhakt who read Rana Ayyub's latest article & was fuming at how she has ""attacked Modi"".

He was not as pissed off at the situation in India, but an Indian writing bad about Modi that too in foreign press, pissed him off. This govt. always delivers what it promises.

>**Chalie Fekna shuru karte hain** In a passage from a biography of  called 'Narendra Modi the man, the times' - by Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, published in 2013, there is a passage which describes his arrest on 1971 and subsequent incarceration in Tihar.

25. @mandeepjassi1 (Mandeep Jassi) Current head of twitter India is a sanghi so it isn't surprising. Before her it was a Kashmiri muslim but he immediately got replaced when he gave a green light and banned right wing handles So social media companies really just follow the Govt in power rather than actual curbing of hate speech! The social media companies do have different standards for different geographies.

There were so many OP-eds that lauded Twitter, FB for suspending Trump. But they fail to realise that it was only after the change in govt was imminent. There has been like 100 such democracy killing moves by the government in this month itself. I think its here. Dictatorship is finally here. It's just sad.. growing up and learning that our Government suppresses speech and the police beat up anyone... it's overwhelming that India isn't what my teachers told me it would be .. I gues that's why they say childhood are simpler times As expected, they are going after the critics. I'm not surprised, when I heard about the suspension of Caravan's account.

To me, it's less about the farmer protests (one of their editors was also writing Op-Eds on NYT about it), but more about its scathing criticism of the government in the past. It had also gone after Ajit Doval's son, accusing him of running an hedge fund in Cayman Islands. This is just one of the stories. It had always held government to account, and reported hard-hitting facts. 

They had it coming. Are we fascist, yet? Govt released a press brief they have suspended all big accounts using Twitter hashtag #ModiPlanningFarmerGenocide for fake, intimidatory & provocative Tweets.

 EDIT : Carvan was not part of this nuking. Different incident. I apologise If Twitter can ban Donald Trump for inciting violence, why is it taking the opposite stance in India? 1975"
j3su2j,"I think if we really want to charge Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family with hypocrisy in this case, we have to look at a similar case in which he may have behaved differently. (Un)Fortunately, we have such a case: the Nirbhaya one. (I don’t believe the Raj govt reacted with the callousness and shocking incompetence in the case that you mentioned that the U.P. govt did in the Hathras rape.)

Nirbhaya was raped and brutalised by a bunch of rapists in a territory ruled by a Congress CM at a time when the prime minister was also a Congressman. However, in that case, the Indian government (led by the Congress) paid for her to be airlifted to Singapore and treated, Mrs Gandhi and PM Singh waited at the airport to receive her body and Manmohan (the ‘silent PM’) addressed a press conference on it, Mrs Gandhi visited the family, her own father lit her funeral pyre, and the government did not dismiss her rape as fake news. This is the most basic we can expect of our government, and we shouldn’t pat them on the backs for doing their job. But this is a lot more than what the current dispensations in Delhi and Lucknow are doing, and certainly dispels the hypocrisy charge.

Apart from that, Rahul Gandhi quietly helped out her family emotionally and monetarily, got her brother through aviation school (I believe) in his constituency, and remained in touch with the family much after the incident.

Are the Gandhi family hypocrites in this particular case? I don’t think so. But if you feel differently even after reading all of this, then that’s your prerogative.

EDIT: Smriti Irani gave bangles to Manmohan Singh during the Nirbhaya case. Is she planning on giving it to Yogi Adityanath?",Everyone who is saying that Congress is in Hathras “ONLY” for political ambition read this.,Politics," It's not just about getting compensation and supporting the family, which yogi thinks is enough. There was actual conviction and due process of law to punish the guilty.

Here the law machinery is bending backwards to reduce this tragedy to a mere statistic. 
The administration are trying to silence the victim's family. 
They are also running a PR campaign to politicise and negate this tragedy. 
They have restricted media.

The whole thing reeks of a rotten system working to protect the culprits.
The whole thing reeks of silencing communities through rape and caste violence and then fucking denying both charges.

These are the promised ideals of a great bharath. Maybe Rahul Gandhi SHOULD politicize the issue if that is what it take for justice, law & order to be restored.

Rahul Gandhi not politicizing rape looks like this:
https://m.timesofindia.com/india/rahul-gandhi-looked-after-us-emotionally-monetarily-but-asked-us-too-keep-it-a-secret-says-nirbhayas-father/amp_articleshow/61477194.cms

It goes unnoticed and forgotten while he is labeled as Pappu Thank you for this! And nothing wrong with politicizing this. The current government is handling the case so badly. What the ef are they doing to the victim's family? Have we even progressed from Nirbhaya's case? In fact, we are going backwards in all these. They are freaking covering this up so blatantly!

We as a country have failed by bringing them in power. Rahul Gandhi is always at the receiving end of the trolls, now I have started seeing him in a new light. Excellent post. The problem with this country is that people forget all that and vote blindly for these criminals who are leading us onto a path of destruction. Congress gets a lot of flak but at-least they didn't muzzle voices of people and commit such barbaric acts which were seen in Hathras. I remember Manmohan Singh's prophetic words every time that history will be kind to him. I feel 50 years down the line history will be kinder to that congress government too. Thanks OP for explaining the timeline.

This will help understand the current events being played out.

BJP is getting exposed by the hour.

There is no Ram Rajya in UP - only Gunda Raj.

I shudder to think what this motherfucker Ajay Bisht will do to the country if he is elected as Prime Minister.

Edit: Ajay Bisht = Yogi Adityanath In other words, there was accountability back then which is totally lacking now. Ah yes bangles - associated with women so automatically assumed to be a sign of weakness/cowardice and whatnot. The current scenario is really really bad and I'd honestly prefer Rahul Gandhi over what we have right now. The current government simply lacks class and it looks like we're being governed by people who have no idea how to run a country. With each passing day I'm more convinced that Rahul Gandhi is the better choice > Smriti Irani gave bangles to Manmohan Singh during the Nirbhaya case. Is she planning on giving it to Yogi Adityanath?

This is a brilliant idea - opposition parties should do it. Where the fuck is BSP and Mayawati disappeared to? Those bastard BJPigs who politicized SSR's death are now blaming others of politicizing this issue. We also need to call out : republic tv which is the most corrupt channel in the country.

jc51zn,,"A post to bring attention to the absolute dismal conditions of doctors all around the country. Doctors working in hospitals under NDMC, Delhi (under BJP) have not been paid since that last 4 MONTHS. They have been on strike for 2-5 days with very little media coverage",Politics," Also, to add to this:

1. They've been clearly told that they will cut salary for the number of days they are protesting

2. If a doctor gets COVID, they are not given sick leave. If they take any leaves, it is counted as a paid leave for which salary is cut and if they try to apply for sick leave, they are asked to justify how they got COVID in the first place since they're using masks (not applicable everywhere but this is the case in these hopsitals)

Also, please don't make comments saying 'but doctors are charging so much money everywhere'. Wrong. It's the management which does that and all that money goes into their pockets. This logic is the equivalent of assuming anyone who works in jio must be a millionaire because jio is a multi million dollar company. 

Source: I am a doctor This is really sad. I don’t understand how the government is treating the most important people right now so poorly. What can we do to help? [deleted] A harsh reminder that helicopters and airplanes flying over hospitals and military bands playing on the streets was just a jumla. The government doesn't give damn about the doctors or other medical workers. Even from a completely selfish standpoint, this is asinine, since not protecting and paying the medcial workers during a pandemic is literally guaranteeing that  the pandemic will have worse effect and the economy will tank as more people get sicker than they absolutely have to, because of the dearth of medical workers. So, these guys can actually write in a decent handwriting!? I'm shocked.

Jokes apart, no time is a good time for not giving salaries. And this is the worst possible time for just that. Saving lives or not, these doctors have been busting their ass since last 6 months covering for the fuck ups of pradhan sevak, the admin should at least respect the efforts and pay up what is due. First get your ass worked and get into medical school and give your minimum 8 years of life to non stop book reading and in the end stand in front of some 12th failed politician's office to get to your hard earned money. What we can do so that they get the media attention they deserve? Sad Nobody wants to give this attention because we have forgotten about the pandemic, vaccine, unemployment and only focused on weed, some Bollywood celebrities, Hindu versus Muslims none of which is going to solve the crisis brought on by the pandemic. Shows where our priorities lie as a nation. What can we do honestly? This is part of the curse of being born in a developing country headed by a moron.

And to what end can we keep blaming the establishment without acknowledging the widespread apathy among the public.

When there is more public outrage and tv debates over tanishq ad and Rhea's 40g or weed, than doctors not getting paid during a pandemic. how the fuck can we expect things to change. The govt wants the public health sector to collapse along with all else."

hfip20,,‘Anyone found selling Ramdev’s Covid-19 medicine will face action’: Rajasthan minister,Coronavirus," Ahh. Taking strict action against the seller. But no action against the big daddy ramu baba. My question is if Patanjali got approval only for immunity booster/ cough, how could they test it (or even claim to test it) on corona tested patients? is that legal? Waisey since we are at loggerheads with Nepal and [Patanjali CEO is Nepali](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/baba-ramdev-aide-balkrishna-nationality-lies-nailed-135392-2011-06-10) shouldn't we be boycotting this product anyways due to our deshbhakti that is running in our veins. Jai Hind. Vande Matram. I have always hated Patanjali. Such an overrated company. If this was done in any other country apart from India this Baba n his accomplice Balakrishna would have been in jail for quackery n selling immunity boosting churan/cough syrup as cure for Covid19. 

He won't be touched as he was instrumental in bringing the NDA to power along with frauds like Anna Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal, Prashant Bhushan, Seetaram Yechury, super cop Kiran Bedi etc. India is beyond redemption unless people realise their true strength n voice their opinions fearlessly.

""Human trials cannot be carried out without permission of state government,"" he added. ""Those conducting trials without government permission are misleading the people and strict action will be taken against them,"" he said.

gybd5r,,No sympathy for pregnant women i guess,CAA-NRC-NPR," By focusing on Safoora's pregnancy and calling for sympathy (not just this post btw. you can see this line of thinking in a bunch of recent articles and posts by liberals), you are reframing the debate in a counterproductive direction. Sympathy is something the observer chooses to grant or withhold on the basis of the difficulties the subject faces. A judge doesn't have any obligation to behave ""sympathetically"". You won't find the constitution talking about how central ""sympathy"" is to its values. What is happening here reveals not merely an absence of sympathy, but an absence of justice.

The Delhi Police has made their biases known time and time again, including during the course of the actual riots. Now, Safoora and other student activists are being implicated in a ""conspiracy"" regarding which their charge sheets have contained way more bluster than basic facts. The fact that a ""conspiracy"" to create a roadblock is being used to deny somebody bail is nothing less than a miscarriage of justice. Indian people need to learn that the government doesn't owe its people sympathy, it owes them justice. No sympathy for any dissenting voices at all. The state of law and order in the country is a tragedy, and it's a tragedy all the way up to the Supreme Court. The police, the politicians, the judge, and the jury are all in on it. It's getting scarier living here because you never know what you might be picked up for. Maybe it was always like this and I'm seeing/feeling it for the first time because I'm getting older and my perspectives are changing, but fuck. It feels so hopeless sometimes y'know? I guess that is the status of Indian law and order now where real criminals run free due to political connections and protestors in such delicate situation are kept imprisoned. Shame!

5. Age doesn't fetch respect, but it fetches experience. Absorb as much as you can from them, and do what you will with it. This needs to be put on a poster and mass produced... with some reference to the vedas or Modi so they actually listen. 

And for the person saying “tHeY pAy fOr EverYthIng” 
.... you realize children don’t ask to be born? Or that parents don’t exactly pay for everything selflessly? Or that there is the constant unsaid quid pro quo that forces so many children to be their parents’ retirement plan? 

Even if they did pay for everything, they
*chose* to have kids and pay for it. Good good man, people don’t even treat pets this way. I don’t know anyone who got a pet and reminded that pet everyday of how much they’re doing for them. Why do you people have so much
Stockholm syndrome. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk. In TN, it's always carried you for 10 months.. Not to brag but my parent's actions agree with all the points on this list. Since I live in a household which struggles financially and my father makes every decision, I just wish that men and women both should only get married when they feel that they are ready to carry the responsibility of someone other than yourself. My neighbour used to beat his two sons with a belt and they grew up to be the same as their fathers. They both have serious anger management issues and their fighting gave so much stress to their mother that she developed number of diseases and died. Their father married them at 22-23 y/o and now they both have 1 child each. Both of them beat their wives and the parents of the wives are SO SUPPORTIVE that when the girls ran back home after serious fights, the parents sent them right back to their husband. Now the child suffers and will has hellish childhood where they see their mothers being victims of do.estic violence on a daily basis. Idk how it came from this post to my fucked up family life to my neighbour's fucked up family but ty for reading my rant"

mvch5j,,Under-reporting of Covid deaths in India - Financial Times (Link in comments),Coronavirus," Good to see Gujarat modal/model being implemented nationwide. Numbers should also be made public about people who did not get medical care because of covid overload in hospitals. Patients of heart attack, TB, stroke etc. Gee I wonder what is common to the 6 different cities in 3 different states. In my small town, we have the local newspaper publish a list of people who were cremated in both crematories of the city every day. We used to have 3-4, a maximum of 5-6 names in the list. nowadays, we get news that 30-40 people died of Covid but when I see the list of the people cremated in these two crematories of my cities, it adds up to around 80 every dam day and I tell this to my family every fucking morning. My maternal uncle is a doctor and he told us that in the hospital where he is working atleast 4 to 5 patients are dying daily due to COVID only so you can see the condition is critical in our country if this is condition of one hospital and there are many hospitals in our country. I read somewhere that in the US they compared the total deaths for the year with the previous year and then compared them to arrive at an estimate for the deaths due to Covid. Can a similar thing be done for India? So, are we the Chinese yet? Why can't there be a proper investigative journalism on this? Take all states into account to remove any charges of political bias.  It's time to put irrefutable data in front of the nation and the world. It's time to name and shame these idiots. India is #1 in the world in terms of the absolute number of deaths, not the US. This should've been obvious to anyone who's following the statistics. abki baar antim sanskaar! Modi ji makes me so hard  I could stare at his beard the whole day. I've recorded his recent speeches in 4k and me an my RSS lovers pour ourselves a tall glass of gau peshab and tonic water, the RSS lovers like neat, just like there pretty bums. 

Oh yeass modi ji, earlier I though yogi and modi were na mard cuz of no child but now I think they've been getting all types of love from the RSS, specially cuz they recruit very young boys only from UP. My gujju uncles like young up boys, sometimes yogi pretends to be 15 when he wears his brown chaddi and runs around vrindavan for modi ji to Chase, I love his 56inch tits also. 

I love you modiji."
n5k4mg,"This is what I expect. Once we have enough vaccines and enough oxygen to stabilize the situation, he will have a prime time address to the nation where he will appear with folded arms and say something along there lines:

2. I tried my best by working day and night.

3. The states were not prepared for such crisis.

4. Due to my relationship with other countries we were able to get medical supplies and save lives of lakhs and crores of people.

Modi will win by a bigger majority.","After all of this is over, Modiji will appear on TV crying asking for forgiveness and people will forget the horrors that they had to go through.",Politics," Right wing media is going to blame Muslims for spreading corona during Eid( may 12/13). That will give him the excuse he needs I had written the below in a different thread. Pasting it here.


Cry, then apologize (yes!), then declare national mourning for a week, then appeal to people's emotions by making healthcare his no. 1 priority. Some serious work will be done to undo the damage and to try and create the image that Covid-19 was a misstep that ANY govt would have failed. 

Then a lot of work will be done to win UP. If BJP loses UP then 2024 mein they will lose for sure. I don't think so,

He's so egoistic he won't ever admit what he did wrong.

Also, it's our responsibility to throw him out not only from power but also from the country.

Always remember what he did. Fuck it I am going to say it. You can not hand over a country to petty businessmen who will put profits first. Black marketing is happening top to bottom. All illusions about desh bhakti has been ripped apart. Our politicians are shit. But this lot are incompetent, cruel and hopelessly corrupt. Was Congress really more corrupt? At least they had compassion for tge weakest. Aur chutiya middle class , that suddenly decided they were all Ambanis in waiting , bitching about freebies- aukat mein aa gaye saale? From doctors to ambassadors to businessmen, all have died gasping for breath.  No compassion was shown to you. If there is not a major reboot after this... bas you deserve yogi as PM. Everyday, tens of thousands Indians are dying for lack of treatment, BJ Pee will have no face to show in 2024 election.

BJ Pee gobarment could have set up 5000 oxygen plants and vaccinated half of Indians using PM Cares fund. His government is already propagating success by equating deaths of US vs India.  
To a sanghi, death without hospital is equal to death in ICU. Gov will try to play this number game just so IT cell can state this as 'fact'. Data is being hidden for the same reason. From my understanding, Modi is not getting away with this. If push comes to shove, he might as well get fired from BJP; so that they can keep the party alive in the next election. I'm guessing that he is not the kind to show weakness or admit failure. no, the most likely scenario is that they will find a scapegoat to blame, fire the scapegoat and claim victory against corruption, replace the scapegoat, and continue as before.

they have enough rabid fans to carry this sequence of events off as fact. An absolute megalomaniac like him would never accept his failure. He would jump to take the credit if and when this crisis is over. Unfortunately a majority of people who vote would blindly buy that too. A shrewd politician never accepts their mistakes. Ever.

In case of Modi, I don't think he will apologize. There a couple of things he and his party members and spokespersons will do.

The most obvious thing to do is to blame state governments. And, to be honest, except for Kerala, all other state governments are somewhat responsible for not addressing the current covid wave. Their lack of effort, however, is overshadowed by that of the central government. But BJP members and supporters will run it non-stop. The supporters have already started shouting ""health is a state issue"" and central government can not be held responsible for this. The will blithely ignore the dire situations in BJP governed states. Hint hint UP and Gujarat. They will repeat this so many times and in so many twisted ways that people who voted BJP in previous elections and are on the fence will jump right back in. This will also include those people who were directly affected by it and lost their family members.

The second thing is the question that we have been hearing for past ten years: ""If not Modi then whom?"". They will, however, pitch it in a different way. They will ask, ""imagine what would have happened if Rahul Gandhi (or anyone else) was PM? Do you think he would have done a better job?"" A logical person will say, ""I don't know because Gandhi was not the PM when it happened"". An illogical person will simply say, ""No"". The ""No"" is so simple and it will resonate with a lot of people.

Third thing they will latch on to is past Congress governments. ""The health infrastructure is bad because Congress did not improve it during past sixty year. It is illogical to expect Modi to have improved health infra in one year"". A logical person knows that this is an extraordinary situation that required Emergency level attention from both state and central government. An illogical person will believe, ""Yes, Modi, Yogi and Rupani are not superheroes. They can not do what Congress was supposed to do in past sixty years.""

Fourth is reserved for people who usually don't shout. They assume every problem this country faces is because of its population. If the population wasn't this huge, there would not have been a shortage of oxygen, hospital beds, and vaccines. These people will, however, fail to ask themselves the critical question: ""Did the population arrive to its current level within one year? A good planner would have considered this when the first wave hit us."".

The fifth is the way of the coward. ""What happened has already happened. Lets move ahead and build a better India. A Vishwaguru"".

All of the above are just talking points. People might resort to some other bullshittery when debating this."

Crackers came in to this country with Europeans,"" she wrote.

*""I have a complaint against you. My complaint is that...I came here (Asanol, West Bengal) twice during Lok Sabha elections. The first time I came asking you to vote for ME.

litcgl,,China Never Entered,Politics," China realized, it was no use attacking China 2.0. Schroxinger's China. I am curious why Indians do not seem to entertain the possibility that the entire thing on the border with China was an attempt to coverup the Modi government's incompetence with covid and the economy? 

Remember, the border issue was blown up in the media just when covid was getting bad in India, and the economy was in shambles. Then all of the sudden, all the attention went to the border issue, and the government had caught a break. 

To an outsider, this seems like an classic distraction strategy. The Chinese were doing what they have had always been doing (since it is a disputed border), except that the Indian side decided to make a big deal and publicize it this time for internal political reasons.  

Do any Indians feel the same way? And bhakts believed both 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️... Bhakts may realize someday that they got a raw deal.

Also posting this because most people outside Tamil Nadu dont know how gem of a person Siddharth is. As this news wasnt covered much outside local media.

l93b5t,,Indian Redditor's Continue To Raise Voice Against Whitehat Jr's Attempt To Quell Criticism | Techzei,Business/Finance," Madhuri Dixit and Farah Khan too..such a tragedy Now Hrithik Roshan is promoting this shitfest. Let's be honest. The members of Indian Reddit can come together and make a better course program. Whitehat jr is just a big scam and now there is toppr coder is also created. It’s so annoying. Kids deserve to spend their childhood playing outdoor games but these people just want them to learn coding to build their future at 6 years of age wtf man. And they aren’t even teaching coding they just use blocks and teach them to arrange them. Coding is not as simple as that I know because I am a IT student myself.These people just want money . Do you think it will get better with subsequent iterations? It is just another way of pushing kids down a path society deems suitable. Kids are being denied the freedom of choice by being pushed into such programs. Someone should start **Asshat Jr** I guess Byju's acquired Whitehat Jr.? Hope you are aware of what kind of an employer Byju's is, had this been the US, there would be class action lawsuits filed against them for exploitative employee treatment. But here they get away with filing libel suits against anybody raising a voice against them.
Little surprise they went for Whitehat, parents send their pre-nursery kids for tuition - kids who can't read, write and even speak properly. So, people do think that learning coding at 6 will give their children an advantage.
Playing outdoors is not attractive for the parents anymore. You can't tell your peers that your son/daughter plays in the park for four hours everyday, what's there to be proud of? But you can definitely gloat over the fact that your toddler can code at 6 and has created an app (which nobody needs or uses, but that's besides the point)!

n3o258,,It Isn't Just Modi. India’s Compliant Media Must Also Take Responsibility for the COVID-19 Crisis,Politics," Not only Media, the Indian Judiciary is equally responsible, for not keeping the government in check and giving them a free hand to do whatever they want. Abki Baar, Antim Sanskaar! Media, or rather the mainstream media (MSM), will take as much responsibility for what happened as much truth they report. Which is to say, none. 

Yet, it was the MSM that led the charge for Modi - they lied, brainwashed people, hid the crimes, ridiculed opposition, obfuscated reality, at the twin altars of Modi and Business (profits). And lo and behold, now, they have blood on their hands, an ocean's worth of blood, including some belonging to their own family. Frack the Mainstream Media, and all their celebrity minions, too. It's mostly Modi's fault. When reporters and press are arrested for doing their job this is what happens.

- The Corruption Of India in 3 Easy Pieces. Modi or Modia will take responsibility if they have any bit of morality / honesty left in them.

Guess what? They both are selfish goondas pretending to be white collar. I have been appalled at this! Neither The Times, nor The Economic Times has even mentioned a word about Modi`s genocidal calls! Nor on the drastic and systemic obfuscation of the true death toll! Infact all our problems are a result of
media giving modi blowjobs instead of doing their duty as the 4th pillar of a democratic govt. If only they had rightfully criticised him and his cabinet for all their blunder they would never have won a second term in first place. This government getting away with all the hate, misgovernence, corruption is a result of the media feeding people lies and suppressing oppostion voices. Opposition voices are supposed to be amplified by media. Infact for a democratic govt to be at its best media should assume the role of opposition constantly correcting their mistakes and offering support for good goverence and during crisis. The Indian media was more interest in reporting on the covid mishaps of other countries like Pakistan. Here are some examples.

Perhaps Indian media should be paying more attention to India's attempts to control covid, than poking fun at the Pakistani. tldr; As India's COVID-19 second wave began to surge last month, the country’s largest-selling newspaper, the Hindi-language Dainik Bhaskar, splashed its front page with a night-time shot of a crematorium in the city of Bhopal, dotted with the ghoulish orange glow of pyres. ""The government's data are fake, the pyres tell the truth,"" the headline read.

*Summary generated by [sansa](https://sansa.news/)* What about Indian citizens? For voting BJP inspite of knowing about Gujarat, for wearing their masks incorrectly or not wearing masks, for going out in millions to Kumbh mela or voting for elections or following bollywood celebs or travelling or watching shitty government sponsored media. Its the viewers who keep republic tv going.

Lets not delude ourselves, this was a great team effort. The ones who can be excused are the ones who did all they could and sympathies to those who are suffering inspite. Stop idolizing and putting all the accountability on Modi the Inidan healthcare has been broken since independence."

As someone personally affected by this crisis (I lost my cousin 2 weeks ago), I'm frustrated and I've given up.

Translation: Do whatever you want, Modi will come again. Some sanghi ,when presented with the current scenario of the country, commented ""Haan, UPA ke time pe toh hum America the""

That fact that we are worse now than we were then doesn't matter to these imbeciles,  the fact that we weren't golden back then is enough to justify being a shithole now!

I shudder to imagine how brainwashed an individual has to be to put someone's ass before their own interest just because their ego is not strong enough to agree they were wrong. Because BJ Pee may be winning elections after elections by swapping EVMs at transit/in strong rooms and buying MLAs/MPs.

Ayega to Fodiji hi. This is the problem. Chutiyas like him can get away even with murder these days. As long as you lick the supreme one's gand no one's touching you. A very good example to set how we are our biggest enemy. Its not Pakistan. Its not China. Its not the filthy west. It is us.   


Every Indian who is killed by the ""enemy"" has been over deliberate action. Actions none of us agree with but they had purpose. But people dying now are dying because of indifference. It is so much worse in so many ways I can't even begin to describe it. To make it even worse, they are being killed by our own people. Again, not for any evil messed up purpose. Just indifference.  


Sure call me out on my strawman argument. Try and justify our government's actions. Yeah people would have died in a pandemic anyway, right? There is literally nothing we could have done to prevent it, right? Comparing the Modi cult to a fucking spineless servant would be an insult to spineless people and servants. There exists no insult to describe how deplorable the people who support this bullshit. With all due respect, ""ye takla chutiya pagla gaya hai"""

jz9x9r,"I wanted to know more about this guy, since he seemed to appear very shifty and shady in the Slack conversations that Pradeep Poonia shared.  
  
And then I stumbled upon these two articles, written by him in 2016, a couple of years before founding WhiteHat Jr. (which FYI, is a copy of MIT's Scratch Jr)  
  
https://www.scratchjr.org/  
  
These are the two articles I am talking about:

Notice how he wants his kids to pursue whatever they want and excel in it, but is hellbent on shoving coding (in a very shitty manner) down the next generation of India's kids. He keeps posting about yoga and zen and the likes but has complete disregard for the mental harm he is causing to potentially millions in this country. I escaped the shitty ""coaching classes"" culture of India but found that in the last 4-5 years, its kinda becoming the same for interviews in the tech sector (I am looking at you, LeetCode and HackerRank). But at least thats aimed at adults ranging from 18 to retirement.  
  
If shitty ed-tech companies like Byju's and WhiteHat Jr succeed, we are ensuring the doom of young children in India (as young as 6) to the rat race that will eventually lead to more common occurrences of depression and suicide.  
  
More power to you /u/pooniahigh  
  
This is Arindam Chaudhuri and IIPM all over again, except that its a much bigger monster backed by big VC money. God bless Maheshwar Peri and others who took down IIPM. It's time we take down this next generation of scam that has a much bigger influence on our society (we can't let this coaching culture become the norm as soon as kids get out of kindergarten!)  
  
PS: SRK has endorsed IIPM in the past. Fair and Handsome too. He is now endorsing Byjus. Guess he likes peddling things that harm society in general.  
  
Edit: **Hark back to the days when you were a kid between 6-12 years old. What was your normal day like? Comment on this post your approx schedule, if you can remember it.** I can still remember mine (in Mumbai, over 20 years ago):  
  
Wake up at 6:45 am.  
School at 7:30 am.  
Come back home at 1:30 pm  
Have lunch while watching Cartoon Network (Toonami was awesome. Swat Kats and Dexter's Laboratory were my favorites). Do homework.  
Play box cricket (or on a ground if there is some space) from 5:30 pm to 8:00 pm  
Dinner, some TV (Surabhi, Shriman Shrimati, Kaun Banega Crorepati in later years?) and then bed (or any last minute homework).  
  
Notice that except for school and homework, there was a lot of time to enjoy, play and live life.  
  
Now imagine the same for your kids if WhiteHat Jr and Byjus succeed in brainwashing gullible Indian parents into enrolling them into their scam. Yeah, the end result is pretty fuckin scary!","The hypocrisy and irony of Karan Bajaj, CEO of WhiteHat Jr",Business/Finance," I see Swat Kats, i upvote Why do Indian parents have to be so gullible? They're okay with putting their children through hell in the hope of good prospects. Half the parents don't even follow the economy. They just fall for all kinds of bullshit. Same timetable as yours

5 pm was booked for Pokemon :') Dude I watched one the videos on the pooniah‘s telegram channel, I couldn't believe when the “teacher” told the little 6th grade girl, “THIS WILL ALSO BE VERY IMPORTANT LATER WHEN YOU GO FOR YOUR PLACEMENTS AS THEY WILL ASK FOR CODING KNOWLEDGE”. What.In.The.Actual.Fuck. A sixth grader, innocent child, being told all this utter crap. The main problem lies with the parents. Every parent wants their kid to be the next Bill Gates/ Steve Jobs and will go to any lengths to ""provide quality education"". I tutor kids part time and had a mother come up to me to teach her 10y/o daughter science and maths. I was expected to teach her 4 days a week, including weekends, from 8-10pm. She came back from school at 5 and had other tuitions right after. All this, for a 10y/o. Even though I refused to teach her in this condition, I'm sure she got someone else to do it. [deleted] I was busy leveling up my Pokemon when i was 12. This is all happening because of how shitty indian parents are .They see kids as investments. Fuck them and also Fuck Whitehat Jr for false advertising I don't understand why SRK keeps endorsing things like this. His daughter ranted on instagram about being called dark all her life but it was ironical considering SRK endorsed fairness cream at a time when he could have picked a stance against fairness cream and made a difference. Lazy parents don't want to do parenting, and think their job is done by throwing money... Eh. There used to be tuitions earlier, with kids doing 2-3 hours of private tuition post school.
Now coding is the new rage. 10 years down the line, it will be something else.


Parents who are financially secure form a very small part of the population. Most parents are worried that their kid might get left behind in the world. Companies prey on this fear and create business models. Fear sells."

During winter when coming from college, I bought this packet thinking it may have extra 2 or 3 extra biscuits. Got fresh, milk warmed, laptop opened, packet opened and the next word I said was behanchoood. social distancing above everything sir. Cmon bro, it clearly says 20g extra. grams can come from anywhere. Is everyone sure that this is not just a simple case of Biscuits social distancing and trying for herd immunity?? No it's the hide part. They don't care about your seek part. 20g extra chutiya kaata gaya hai in this packaging. The reason why they do these tactics is because
Of the people if you increase the price of product no one will buy prices are rising, inflation is happening it is not possible for them to keep giving this in 20-25 rs while giving same quantity. So now they have 2 options
A) increase price 
B) decrease quantity
C) reduce quality


A) price increase doesn't work because say they make it 30rs in a country where people are struggling to eat each day a price increase lowers the customer base
C) reducing quality  obviously destroys the company's good will 
B) therefore decreasing quantity seems better 


Now giving this "" air slot"" in between just increases the likelihood of making it look attractive
Now this just makes you feel cheated.

I don't know if it works but I suggest others to do it too if you find someone needing mental help. Tweet link.

- Chirag Jaipal (our OP?)

- Yogesh Jaipal (I tried to message him, but his profile is private): 

- Jayant Jaipal, who is from Rajasthan and likes to play ""Playerunknown's battlegrounds mobile"", the exact same game that Chirag Jaipal posted on an Instagram story some time ago. Among Jayant's friends there are at least 20 people with last name Jaipal, the majority of which is from Rajasthan. I tried to message them, but no one answered. 

Sorry if I didn't post the Facebook and Instagram links, but my post keeps getting removed. 
I hope this helps. [deleted] I private messaged him when he posted initially to help him out financially but he never responded Is he found? He seems to be a fan of 6ix9ine.

I was 6 and I still remember my mother crying while watching the news until she called my dad and heard he was okay. Damn...still sends chills down my spine. It's been twelve years  (was just 8 back then) but this is as clear as it was back then. Never forget. Never forgive >Twelve years of the 26/11 Mumbai Terror attacks. Ten Terrorist FROM PAKISTAN, 157 dead, 300 wounded.

Ten Terrorists FROM PAKISTAN!!!

Born, brainwashed and trained FROM PAKISTAN!

ftfy. Never again. I know I am touching the raw nerve of the hivemind here, but this was the moment I felt truly disgusted by the sheer incompetence of Congress govt in handling terrorism. There were attacks going on for years, but they were still caught unprepared. The overall response after, those dossiers of evidence, was just the nadir of meek submission.

I doubt if any time in history, a country, Pakistan in this case, got away by paying so less for such aggression. I just wanted this to be a dream or something I wish wasnt true....but I cant......I was there and I witnessed it ....the horror ...blood...screams, and then these idiots made it into a political issue These were some dark days. I remember I was in class 8 back then, and used to sit glued to the TV for the latest updates on the rescue operations after coming home from school. I had spent a part of my early childhood in Mumbai and my parents had stayed even longer there, so the news of the attacks and everything that followed were really painful for us. Can't even begin to imagine how harrowing it must have been for the people who were there back then.     

Hope the innocent people who lost their lives are resting in peace, and the people who lost their near-and-dear ones are doing better."
he9ue7,"This started happening the night Prime Minister announced that nothing has happened in Ladakh. Many retired army officials criticized this announcement and demanded to know the complete truth. Since then, the supporters of this political party have been abusing and calling names those these officers who gave 30 years of their life serving this nation. 

I is sad to see that the party and supporters who have made a career out of nationalism and gained votes on death of soldiers have no respect for army officials who spent their life protecting this country. 

I know and understand that their career has some blots but no one is perfect especially those who are now calling them names just because they dared question the supreme leader for his incompetency.","Only In India, Supporters of a Political Party have guts to call decorated army personnel anti nationals and cowards",Politics," Recently in the United States, General Mattis recently got a lot of hate from Trump supporters after he denounced him publically so it's not just an ""only in India"" thing. And BJP supporters are fans of BJP, not India so of course anyone who doesn't support them is a villain. The fake garb of nationalism is unfortunately worn by the masses too, who feel that they are doing something good for the nation by supporting Modi and after 6 years, cannot come to terms with their blindness. The army is not above criticism. Any democratic country hold their military accountable when they do something wrong. But this reaction from the govt is not that. This is a temper tantrum from the govt because the army dares oppose their lies and is asking tough questions. This is an attempt by the govt to shut down rightful criticism of their actions because they think no one should challenge them on anything they say. They are treating the army like they treat dissidents and critics in this country, and they would probably try to put them in jail for the criticism if they could. As @ RoflGandhi\_ on twitter said:   
Retired army officers jo kabhi desh ke liye bandook pakde khade the, unhe deshdrohi kaha jaa raha hai. Aur ralliyon mein kursi lagane wale, jo Redmi 5 pakde khade hain, wo Deshbhakt bane hue hain. Strange times. I've said this before and I'll say it again, Sangh supporters are driven by hatred. Hatred for muslims, hatred for rich, liberals, leftists. They were never reasoned into that position. They just found someone who said what they wanted to hear.  They'd eat a shit sandwich if it meant you'd smell their breath. Berating the army is nothing  to them. They'd berate their mothers and sisters if they voted against their wish. Most of armed forces vote for BJP as they fall for their pretend ""nationalism"" like playing national anthem in movie theatres or beating people up who dares question the leader.

BJP milked Balakot and Pulwama a lot, it's sad to see army men falling for it. 

You and I both know, even after this shit show, most army men will still vote for BJP.

We get what we deserve. 



Source for armed forces voting for BJP : 

https://theprint.in/politics/bjp-swept-votes-of-armed-forces-because-congress-scored-a-self-goal-in-its-manifesto/268627/ This will be the trend if we don't have strong General sitting at top instead of sycophants.

After the position of Colonel, the promotion is entirely dependent on politics and connection.

We need strong leadership like Sam Manekshaw Tatti elects tatti. 
We have a long way to go guys.
Educate people around you. Dont preach on social media what you don't understand it could be propaganda. 
Peace. Love y'all. It’s not just only in India. I have given up all hope on humanity. Time and again we as a society have failed each other, and have not learnt a thing. 

It’s this us vs them mentality that is the root of all the problems. And I guess it stems from the fact that we crave for something larger than life, some identity. For most it’s religion or nationality. From these concepts they inherit ethical drive whereas this drive should be common sense. But alas. Just 3 years ago they were saying

 ""Siachin mein hamarey jawan... "" Most army brats and retired army personnel still support BJP and are more pro modi than your regular civilian.It is mainly because of their one rank one pension scheme ,hindutva and anti reservation agenda. Those spineless party men"
llrrsn,"Hi guys,

Update from my previous post as promised.

Turns out this guy had transferred the ₹24,000 to me accidentally.

With the help of multiple translators between him and me (he only speaks Hindi  and I speak English and Malayalam) I was able to to get them to speak to his bank. 

His bank then got in touch with my bank to report the mistake and I authorised my bank to return the money to the same account if they were satisfied that it was a mistake.

My bank spoke to his bank to the establish that this was all correct.

He’s very happy as he normally only earns ₹12,000 per month so this was a lot of money for him.

Hopefully the universe will favour me due to good behaviour as I’m currently unemployed and looking for work haha.","Update: Google pay scam or accidental transfer of ₹24,000",AskIndia," You're a good guy OP. Bless you!

BTW, what sort of work are you looking for? You are a good man. Recently encountered a scam myself.

So I had posted an ad to sell some used furniture on OLX and Quikr. I got an offer which I accepted, no negotiation or message exchanged. That was a little odd, but I assumed that the person might be buying on behalf of a company or something so I continued with sharing my number.


Got a call from the person to send my address for pickup and he asked if Google pay/Paytm is ok. I asked him to transfer on Google pay. As I was not 100% sure, I shared my area but not house details.


Got a call from him that he had transferred the amount on Google pay. I did not get any sms from back though. Checked Google pay and there was a new transactionm. Though not a payment, but a pay request. I told the guy that this is a pay request and not payment and he went on to explain how if I press on 'pay' and enter my pin the payment will be added to my account. 


By the sound of that person it seemed like this guy has done this multiple times and how many poor souls have this guy cheated. Not sure how and where to report this. Ellam shari avum man. Ping me if you're looking for a job in Kochi, OP Rab rakha bro. so bank can't reverse the transaction without the holder's permission? നീ വലിയവനാടാ... Please make sure with your bank if it was a legit transfer coz sometimes people send money in some sketchy way then ask for refund when they recieve that bank realizes that the transfer was not legit(compromised account/identity theft etc)they cut money from you. so before doing that note down the person's name, contact info etc also get it in written from the person that he accidentally send money and wants it transfered back. aslo that the money was legit and if it wasn't he will be liable...

here is an exteact from the article

> Why Do These Scams Work?

> These scams work because fake checks generally look just like real checks, even to bank employees. They are often printed with the names and addresses of legitimate financial institutions. They may even be real checks written on bank accounts that belong to identity theft victims. It can take weeks for a bank to figure out that the check is a fake.

My advice double triple check if the transfer was legit. Be honest and God will reward you for sure...

I pray for more people like you... Please post your qualifications , any kind soul can help you out . Hearing stories like these keeps my faith in humanity. Godspeed op!"

lm28j3,,Krishna concept sketches done for a TV studio recently. Critique is highly appreciated!,Art/Photo (OC)," I think this will turn out great in the finished product.

Critique would be:

The triceps are non-existent for such a defined body.

The bow looks a bit small in relative to the height of the body.

Down facing-Left hand fingers on the front facing image needs a bit more detailing.

The fingers holding the chakra are gorgeous though. You're a very talented artist. Personally don't get the recent trend of portraying Hindu deities as angry. They aren't Marvel/manga characters. They are supposed to give people peace of mind and spirituality. Looking at an angry face doesn't do that. Just my two paise.  
  
I understand that this might not be your choice. The studio people might have had some instructions/expectations. You've done awesome work. Krishna is always calm and composed even if he is angry.... Here he looks like he's either angry or disgusted..... Sorry for pointing it this way.... I'm not an  artist but since you asked for feedback I think that's how krishna should be portrayed..... The shankha is on the left hand and Chakra should be on the right. But, great drawings though. it is interesting isnt it

Krishna even if  a mythical person, by all accounts was black/brown

I would be very interested in how gods were painted/depicted over the years. It becomes more a reflection of the societal beauty standards, 

A six packed Krishna with defined chin is probably the modern male beauty standard Why is he angry? Why the disgusting look on his face? isn't Krishna supposed to not have four hands, dawg? 

like he's in disguise on earth as a regular ol' human bein' Would be interesting to know musculoskeletal anatomy Can you make sure he and draupadi are black. It is high time they are stoped portrayed as white or blue. What’s with all angry gods ?"

j93l0t,,Apolitical by @sanitarypanels,Politics," [removed] Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are.   - Benjamin Franklin [removed] Being apolitical is a point of pride for some in our era, when people argue that polarization has never been more pronounced. Apolitical people sometimes argue that they’re maintaining the peace by not broaching that thorny topic of politics, or they imply that their position makes them wiser or morally superior than the rest of us mere mortals. 

But being apolitical is also a political choice. Your silence communicates that you don’t care enough to take a stance and that you’d prefer to keep things the way they are: You see nothing wrong or unjust about our world. Better translation: I don't want to waste my time and energy with the discussions that basically go nowhere and I would like to spend the precious few downtime hours from my work in peace. What does it mean to be apolitical? Do I vote? I will now that I have an election card. I think I am informed enough about any decision by the govt. , how they will affect me and others. But I generally don't discuss politics with people. And haven't attended any protest ever. So I don't know where I stand. On the contrary, many of us are just too busy with our lives and personal problems that following and commenting on nuanced political scenarios just seems too much. Just like most of politics, this post does nothing but push blame, try to make one group feel superior over the other and does not really address anything of substance. This is why people are apolitical. How is it that I am not privileged and unaffected at the same time? I believed politics was bullshit when I was 15 year old. Ten years later down the line I see I was right. One of the most easiest way to tell people to stop bugging me. Other example are its not you its me, we will call you.

Have you ever considered that the person may not be interested in a political discussion with you."

Let me blatantly copy a gigantic post made by /u/AllAgTCups. The post was a bit long, so **I had to split it into 3 comments**. 

Some statistics regarding caste and the disparity between the ""upper"" and the ""lower"" castes.

Using the [NSS 2012](http://mospi.nic.in/sites/default/files/national_data_bank/pdf/NSS_68Round-563.pdf) survey data, the population % of these social groups were :

|Social group|Population %|
|:-|:-|
|SC|18.8|
|ST|8.7|
|OBC|44|
|General category/Others|28.5|

According [this study](https://socy.umd.edu/sites/socy.umd.edu/files/pubs/Thorat%20and%20Joshi%202019_The%20Continuning%20Practice%20of%20Untouchability%20in%20India.pdf), about 52% of Brahmins and 24% of Forward castes practice untouchilbilty, not surprising that some of them end up bringing their casteism even abroad, even for educated Brahmins and Forward castes, who recieved some post-grad education, 48% and 27% respectively practiced untouchilbilty.

For the voting in the 2019 elections,

About 61% of the the general category voted for the NDA, while the average vote for it was 45%. [Source](https://www.indiatoday.in/diu/story/how-india-voted-2019-lok-sabha-election-india-today-axis-my-india-poll-1539617-2019-05-31). 

Regarding representation in media,

Of the 121 newsroom leadership positions – editor-in-chief, managing editor, executive editor, bureau chief, input/output editor – across the newspapers, TV news channels, news websites, and magazines under study, 106 are occupied by upper castes, five by other backward classes and six by people from minority communities. The caste of four individuals could not be identified.

1. Three out of every four anchors (among a total of 40 anchors in Hindi channels and 47 in English channels) of debates are upper caste. Not one is Dalit, Adivasi, or OBC
2. For over 70% of their primetime debate shows, news channels draw the majority of the panellists from the upper castes
3. No more than 5% of all articles in English newspapers are written by Dalits and Adivasis. Hindi newspapers fare slightly better at around 10%
4. Around 72% of bylined articles on news websites are written by people from the upper castes
5. Only 10 of the 972 articles featuring on the cover pages of the 12 magazines under study are about issues related to caste.

According to [this](https://www.newslaundry.com/2019/08/02/caste-representation-indian-newsrooms-report-media-rumble-oxfam-india)

1. About 89% of leadership positions in English TV news channels belonged to the general category.
2. About 76% of flagship show anchors belong to the general category.
3. Only 5.6% and 1% of panellists across the surveyed channels belong to SC and ST categories respectively
4. For Hindi news channels 100% of leadership belonged to the general category and 80% of the anchors in primetime shows
5. On discussion of caste issues, 69% of the panellists belonged to the general category across all the surveyed channels.
6. Out of the 16,000 articles written by English newspapers between October 2018 and March 2019, about 60% were written by ""upper""-caste writers.
7. In Hindi newspapers, 56% of writers belonged to the general category, 8.1% to SC and 1.1% to ST categories.
8. Among digital media outlets, 84% of all leadership positions were occupied by those belonging to general category.
9. Articles regarding caste issues in digital media, 56% were written by those from general category.
10. Among magazines, 56% of total output come from general category writers 6.5% from SC/ST combined and 17 % from OBC category.

There is under-representation of Dalits in judiciary. According to [this](https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/india-news-70-years-of-indian-judiciary-opinion-composition-terribly-skewed-higher-levels-bastion-of-upper-caste-males/302658)

In the past 70 years, India only had just ONE Dalit Chief Justice. Currently there are no Dalit Chief Justice in high courts. According to [this](https://www.legallyindia.com/supreme-court/judiciary-remains-a-major-brahmin-bastion-no-sc-st-judge-has-been-elevated-to-apex-court-in-7-years-20180124-9045), no SC/ST person has been elevated to the supreme court in the past 7 years or now we can say 9 years since that was written in 2018.

In corporate also there is under representation, [93%](https://theprint.in/opinion/annihilate-of-caste-in-indian-corporate-possible-but-firms-must-say-dalit-lives-matter/444244/) of Indian cooperate board members belong to the ""forward""-castes, out of which Brahmins make up 45% and Vaishyas make up about 46%.

Similarly qualified SC candidates are less likely to be hired than the general category ones. [This](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40276548?seq=1) study shows that those with Dalit sounding names are 33% less likely to be hired and with Muslim sounding name are 67% less likely to be hired than someone ""upper""-caste sounding name.

There is also a huge income disparity by caste, for SC/ST people, their income is almost half of that of forward-castes. [Source](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Bharti2018.pdf) (page 17) Wealth/assets here is the indicator of presennce of 33 different durable household goods like TV, air conditioner etc.

|Social group|Household income (in Rs./year)|Wealth/Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|

|OBC|18.2|19.6|21.1|22.3|18.8|
|Other|9.4|15.4|18.4|22.8|34.0|

A score of greater than 20 means, there is larger representation of a social group in that quintile than overall for India. You can see the ""lower""-caste have a higher representation in the poorer quntiles. We can see that 50.1% and 70.7% and of the SC and ST households respectively are in the two poorest quintiles.

The overall wealth/asset [share](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/upper-caste-hindus-richest-in-india-own-41-total-assets-says-study-on-wealth-distribution-5582984/) of India's wealth is [heavily](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Wealth-Ownership-and-Inequality-in-India%3A-A-Tagade-Naik/79bd81b0ff05baea522755603a7bda6d5b403be5) concentrated among ""upper""-caste Hindus.

[removed] ###[RESERVATION is about adequate REPRESENTATION, not poverty eradication](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gmxonp/reservation_is_about_adequate_representation_not/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) [removed] [removed] There is a comment here which says that my entire colony has abolished castiesm. This is beyond me, how UC's manage to simplify caste to a mere hand and tool oppression. Caste is not about having lower caste friends. Let me tell you what is caste -

Your surnames Dwivedi, Trivedi, Chaturvedi is caste. These surnames signify your ritual priviledge that the Indo-aryan brahmins gave themselves and imposed on the local dravidian population. The surname is literally a mark of purity like I am a brahmin who has the knowledge of 3 vedas and you are a chamar whose tongue would be chopped off and molten lead poured into your ears if you try to read them.

Your marriages have caste, when you invite the pandit to ceremonies and weddings, that is a symbol of casteism, yagnas and pujas are a vedic concept based off the original chaturvarna system which gave brahmins purity over other castes. That pandit would never keep foot in a dalits house or even basti.

Even today in big cities, I live in nagpur, the central rich uber upper class areas are all inhabited by the UC's and dalits live in the outskirts or cities. Even today the demographic of our country has them living in basti's outside of the cities. 

Most of us which you people find as rich dalits in school are actually first generation rich dalits whose parents somehow got a govt job through reservation and they have still face lobbying caste politics and discrimination in the office space. Both my parents are govt officers and trust me everything happens on the basis of caste. Literally everything, which committee youll be in, where will you be transferred all depends on your caste.

As a rich dalit growing up, it is difficult for us to be a part of the normal rich uper caste hindu kids. Because we just dont have the cultural capital that upper castes do, we often look down on our own culture, our family because we find them crude and cant like them. Our parents are extremely sincere about money even if they earn enough because of the cultural hangover and that makes us hate our own culture even more.

There are more things that I dont have time and cant find the articulation at the moment to write, but yeah, its not that simple, read up on the history of this country and not the sophisticated plastered fancy shashi tharoor ram guha kind of history but the one which starts from the indus valley to the Struggle between the aryans and the dravidians, to the imposition of the vedas and then the Buddha and his Sramanic movement and Kabir and Nanak's Bhakti movement and maybe you will realize that caste is not just keeping slaves o clean your toilets, it is much more layered than that. Use the last census and give reservation to everyone according to their population percentage. So that everyone will only compete against their own caste/religion. Then add a creamy layer provision to elevate poor in each category. No?

h8xang,,"Not a big deal to most, but I made my first chapatis tonight! (I'm a foreigner in India - more context in comments)",Food," For context: I'm a European citizen that moved to India late last year. Initially I lived in Puducherry where I worked with an NGO, but due to Covid19/circumstances I ended up living in Bombay. Masala dosa owns my heart, but I had to learn how to make chapatis while in Maharashtra. I come from a country where food is not so important, so Indian food has been amazing (to be fair, I knew this before I moved here, but yeah). 

I really want to share some of these amazing foods with friends and family back in Europe so I'm learning now. And I know they're not perfectly round, but I'm not looking to get married any time soon anyway ;) Looks thin and soft. Well done mate!  They look good, soft and thin. 
Don't worry about the perfect round shape, it takes a a bit of technique and lot of practice. I used the excuse of ""taking creative liberties with the shape"" until I learnt to make them round. I still cannot get perfect circles, but close enough. 

Just curious, did you make to go with the roti. Hello dear foreigner in India, I am an indian living abroad...this picture left me drooling for some home made chapati!! Kudos and hope you have a very memorable stay in my country. Dude I'm an Indian in India and I don't know how to make these. Nice work! It's a big deal for me. I'm an Indian and probably haven't made a full chapati from start in my life! mein toh bas pani ubaal skta hoon bhai, bhut bada deal hai You make chapatis better than I do! Good show dude. good attempt but huge scope for improvement When putting them inside hot-pots like you have over here, use cloth instead of tissue. Keep a thick clean cloth between two chapatis and one at the base and one at the top. It'll prevent the moisture from ruining the chapatis."

The World needs to know what The Ministry has done to our Green Assam. Ministry (MoEF&CC) gave permission for Oil Drilling too close to the Dibru Saikhowa National Park violating standard norms. As a result of their miscalculations an Oil blowout occurred that led to an oil spill which killed several exotic species, including the Endangered River Dolphin.

Unable to stop the Oil Blowout for the last 13 days, today it caught fire. Villages have been engulfed in flames, More than 1610 families have been displaced. At a time when they should be social distancing they are being held in a village school.

Now Nation wants to know why are we sacrificing our biodiversity, Forests and National Parks for projects that are not even well planned? Why isn’t our National media raising the right questions?This is way more important than the Hindu v.s Muslim debate ! No Prakash Javedkar or any minister has even tweeted about it.

Some reports of IAF dispatching like 3 Fire Trucks, ONGC Gujarat team showing up and saying NOPE after looking at the fire. Also villagers going crazy and pelting stones.

At this point you're going to have to suffocate the source of the fire as opposed to dousing it with water or something. Think helicopters or cargo planes dropping sand. Lets upvote for visibility for folks. As a Muslim I take full responsibility. I am a eco-Jihadi whose goal is to eliminate all wild life and destroy the biodiversity of India.

i58oi6,,India posts it’s second million in just 21 days,Coronavirus," Wish my money savings would increase this way. [removed] What is scary is that the virus isn't limited to hotspots anymore - we see cases rise across the country, which has the potential to blow up and get very very ugly. I went to my nearest 24 seven yesterday. They have posted various guidelines to prevent the spread one of which includes not letting more than 4 customers inside at a time. I was inside with 2 other persons and then came 3 guys without masks. They just entered forcibly even though the guard was refusing them as they wanted their daily dose of beer. They took their time and then came 2 of their friends looking for them so about 8 people were there in a closed shop, 5 of them without mask. 

Still ""sab changa si"" And we want to open schools in September

The amount of people the govt can sacrifice to show that things are normal and the virus is contained can be seen in how much they deny community transmission. I personally don't like to compare countries too much for a multitude of reasons. Firstly testing numbers in all countries are different (both absolute tests, as well as tests per capita/per million). Testing procedures are also different all around the world. In some countries you get your result in 2 days or less while in some places it takes 10 days, which means the virus could easily have infected the person being tested in that period of time. There's also the case of multiple tests for the same person/testing every day for VVIPs.

Then there's the age old issue of corruption where governments all around the world are hiding numbers(cases, tests, deaths). 
Population and population density will also obviously effect every single number that reported, therefore some of the measures are really not indicative of how active the virus is.

In conclusion, we're all fucked cuz the power hungry try to save their asses and the common man is most likely to suffer(not only in India). I hope the common man(and woman) wears a mask, practices social distancing and uses common sense to save themselves from potential death or long term health problems, heavy financial burden due to hospitalization or loss of jobs, and last but not least the guilt and anger of being the reason that someone else died due to this virus. 

TLDR: we're all fucked, wear a mask and save each other Dekh lo Mitro,

.
Kitna **Vikaas** kiya hai maine.. Dekha kya 15 lakh 15 lakh chilla rahe the. Dekho 20 lakh aa gae. Dekha mera vikkas? But community transmission hasn't begun yet in India.
/s The government failed at controlling the spread of the virus, then the government started to control the testing of the virus and it looks like they have failed at it too.

hwxyb3,,Old School Cool - Dr. Manmohan Singh after presenting the 1991 budget,Politics," I have a story about him from the 80's.

He was the head of the planning commission then, and my father was working in a (private) scientific training institute. This institute had its Head office in Mumbai, and was opening a new center in Delhi, after getting some funds from the Planning commission.

To inaugurate it, they though of inviting him as the chief guest, and my dad (a junior at that time) was the person who would escort him. They sent a car to pick him up, and it got stuck in traffic. It reached his house 15 mins after the pre-decided time. Dr Singh was nowhere to be found. His watchman told my dad, that 'Sahab nikal gaye'.

My dad, along with the car began their journey back to the function, and 2 km ahead, found Dr Singh walking on road. They picked him up, and he said that he did not want the people at the Function to wait, and hence decided to walk towards the location himself.

This was a big shock to my dad, who had got used to all big shots in Delhi having Airs, and being late to each and every functions. Class ! One of the Brightest Economists of India. History is kinder to him. That's a lovely office. Princely! madlad ""History will be kind to me"".

I don't know if this question is allowed in this sub reddit or not. 
Thanks

Edit: Thanks a lot for this guidance. I will definitely look into these tips",What to do after death of Parent?,AskIndia," I'm sorry for your loss but in the meantime you need to remember there are certain things that need to be done
1, First and foremost you need to apply for a death certificate. I kniw it would be hard but anywhere your father is concerned, you would need it. You would need it for account annulment and fund transfer in banks. 
2. Write yo the employer in pen on paper about your situation and ask them for alternate employment of family member regardless of educational status and send it by REGISTERED POST with AD attached even if you live close by. Make your case well. These two would help you later if you claim relief from government. 
3. Check out insurance and any property in your father's name or what could cone in inheritence. If inheritence is there try working with investment firm for investment. 
4. Looking for employment should be your next priority, no matter what it is. 
5. Find out about welfare schemes in your area: this might include widow's pension, laal card and other such things. I'm so sorry for your loss. I simply cannot relate with what you must be feeling right now.

**The only practical step I'll give you is be a cynic. Don't give anyone access to your parents' personal spaces (bedroom, cupboard, locker, etc.) until you've yourself gone through it.**

**Don't commit/sign on anything without completely understanding what it says.**

Once things settle down a little bit, go through his belongings with your mother. Your mother may or may not have access to accounts, etc. that your father had access to. He might have personal (term life or life) insurance policies, etc. Most private companies have health insurance and life insurance for their employees. You should be able to avail it now.

Get access of his bank accounts, demat/trading accounts, insurance policy details, etc.. You and your mother should be handling this directly. You would have to follow their respective process to transfer these ownership, and most of them might ask for proof of death.

Once you have a good sense of the assets and liabilities, reach out to r/IndiaInvestments with details. They can help you how to plan forward from there. Lost my dad 12 years ago when I was 18. Here's a few things I learned which might help you:

1. MOST IMPORTANT: be a rock for your mom / siblings. Understand that they might not behave rationally - but it's part of the grieving process. After a few days, encourage them/yourself to ease into normal life. There's gonna be times where you might feel guilty for just feeling happy - don't let that affect you.

2. You're gonna need a support system : talk to your extended family/ your dad's friends and colleagues. They should help you consolidate his finances. Remember to only talk to close relatives/friends. You need to identify those you can trust. Have proper conversations with them so that they can help you out. Keep this circle very limited - people can be huge assholes in the times of distress.

3. Don't wanna sound insensitive, but make sure you get his death certificate issued, and (get the help of a trusted family friend/relative on this) have all his assets/bank accounts transferred to the nominee/legal heir. 

4. Finally - and this is very important - don't let this affect your education. While we can't undo the past, it'll hurt infinite times more if we let it affect our future. I'm around your age and believe me, I got very emotional reading this. Please take care brother/sister. It will be better soon. I hope you will have better days ahead. Please be strong. Don't give up! It all sounds so useless I know, but I really do empathize with you! A lot of state governments offer widow pension. It's not much, around 3k, check on that.

> I am dumb

Everyone is dumb. Don't think too much and focus on your education, don't make any rushed dicisions, future will take care of itself. I was in the same precise position as you three months ago. Every single person in my family, and friends (small number of people I was close with on earth) is now gone. My mother was the last to vanish from this life 800 miles away. I did not find out for five days.

the first three weeks, I felt the weight. 
cried and screamed alone. feared for my life alone... Then I started the process taking charge of the final arrangements, inheritance, notices, working with the banks. Hired an attorney to do the rest.

there is no money left now. 

but my heart and mind is so destroyed, I can't expect to ever put it back together. So I do not bother. I make each day about reading how to manage life. Learning banking, learning investing, learning the laws.

I am more fortunate than most, my family had achieved great things and now their entire history and achievements rest on me to survive.

You must not give up. You must survive. There is no other choice. You will become stronger, I promise... even if you yourself are lost in your heart and mind-Never stop.

Do not give up. Sorry for your loss, this might not be the platform that might provide you with a solution but I will share what I can at this moment and only pray and hope that it will be of some use to you.

* Do you have any savings? If you have, it might be time to momentarily access them and get along until the entire country recovers.
* Please do contact the company your father was working in and see if they can help you out with anything, I do not know your education so I cannot comment.
* Do you have some father figure relatives? Some kind souls in the family? Please do not feel alone or snubbed if some of them give you cold responses. They might also be struggling but definitely touch base with them and seek advice, from uncles, grandmothers, etc etc.
* Friends, you are at an age where you might have some good friends, are there any friends who might help you with monetary relief if needed or approach their parents for help.
* Discuss with your mother, if this is an option.
* If you need someone to talk to, just ping me on chat.

For the moment, you will feel sick, you will feel desperate, but life will find a way to help you shine soon, you will be lonely, you will want to cry at nights, just do it. Just remember my friend, you will rise and you will find a way out of this. I know that no words can bring you peace at this moment, but this is the least I could do for you. In order 

1. Get the death Summary from the hospital and then apply for death certificate - my state - we need to apply online. Check what's the procedure. 


2. If possible go through all the financial documents your dad must have filed someplace. These 'could' include FDs, Savings Accounts, Term Insurance, PPFs or EPFs, Senior Citizen Saving schemes - if any, Post Office Schemes and Bank Locker details.

3. Look for all the property papers if he owned any or you or anybody aware of it. 

4. If government employee - contact the department for Pension (if that exists or the current lumpsome money they currently providing)

Once all of the above has been collated. 

Find out who the nominee is in all the banks for the money to get transferred in their accounts(including locker details - which mostly will have some gold and property papers)

If dad's own any property you'll have to get that mutated to your mom's name or whoever your family decides as the owner and provide proof of death and other documents - like wise also get the Property Tax details mutated - will save you a lot of headache later 

If your dad owned any property that provides rent - there should be a rental agreement with the tenant - that will give you an idea of the rent/month - ensure that 

Same with Vehicles - transfer ownership to your name or whoever your family decides.

I'll add kuch agar yaad aaya toh. Obtain the death certificate of your dad. I think it's to be gotten from the Tehsildar or Mandal Revenue Officer by showing proofs of his death and the cause of his death. I might be off the mark since I don't clearly remember how it went when my dad expired. Then you have to obtain the heir-ship certificate from the same office. Many of us had subscribed to or rather made to subscribe Pradhan mantri jeevan bima yojna by banks when it was announced. Check if your father had this and file a claim. You'll get 2l.  Small amount but it still useful. I am really sorry for your loss. Try to be a source of strength for your family."

ls0sep,,Burden,Politics," How true is this correlation though? Could someone explain? Who makes this retarded shit? They need a lesson in economics. 

The root cause of the ailing public sector is not demonetization. Its inefficiencies and perverted subsidies that continue to support failing and unproductive organizations. Kuchh bhi ! As if PSU were the greatest profitable ventures before note ban... Some people here didn't understand the cartoon at all. Govt is selling PSUs blaming them as a burden on economy, while the real causes are something else. While should govt run PSUs or not is a debate on its own,  many PSUs have been doing well for a long time. And I strongly feel in a country like India PSU are needed in certain sectors. The govt is selling PSU coz they broke. 

Complete privatization will lead to market monopoly in India, and anti-monopoly measures don't work, esp in India. Lobbying for bills will increase, and legislation will become puppets to cooperates if they haven't already. People here support privatization of PSBs and see no harm in it, I get it people think private players will make PSU services better (lol) and we will have efficient functioning like US and Japan etc. Kindly look at their labour laws and Per Capita Encome. Our Middle class is barely middle class acc to International standards. Also people here are of the opinion selling PSUs and not reorganizing them is the solution, then why not privatize FCI ? Its the biggest money sinking hole in our PSU infra. Sell it and give it to the private players and lets see who is willing to even bid for it. If were ready for Privatization in every sector like the government thinks we are , 50 lakh people wouldn't have tweeted modi rojgar do today. Anyway enjoy your 10,000 ka minimum balance and 50,000 ka yearly premium after this is process is complete I am no a Modi fan (you can see my other comments) but this cartoon is unfair. Public sector is very inefficient, extremely corrupt, wasteful and incapable of change. 

Though it’s true that the politicians and the entrenched bureaucracy are to blame for the death nail, it’s unfair to pin all blame on Modi and “note bandi”. The entitled employees haven’t helped the cause either. Weren't most of them all ready in debt? Controversial opinion, but I think selling of public sectors are a good thing. A government shouldn’t be running a business These PSUs are filled with lots of Bhakts WhatsApp uncles, it'll be interesting to watch what they'll come up with to convince themselves. Surely the person who made this cartoon doesn't understand economics. 

Disinvestment has been going on since the days of Vajpayee & MMS continued with the same. 

Apart from Navratna these PSUs were a burden since ages & noteban had nothing to do with this. Effects of Noteban has nothing to do with him selling of PSU."

After all this mess in December we got our penalty amount and recently we paid that amount but now they need that notice that property was sealed or they will not open and they denied to open. And said to file a case in court. We don't have any resources or energy to fight because we lost everything. It was only source of income and due to sealing and covid we didn't earned any money and people just don't care about it only thing they care about is bribe and we have lost around  15 to 20 lakhs and apart from it we are in debt we have taken to sustain our family and to pay penalty. Please guys please help us we really need help. We have done everything they asked us to do but after that also they are denying. 



If you had any clue which will be helpful to us or know something please tell and share if you can. 

Please upvote guys and if you don't want to upvote please don't downvote it is not joke its serious. 

Edit - we have rented our property to another person and he was plastic manufacturer. They sealed our property on bases of pollution we didn't had proper documents

Thanks.",I need your help. Please if you can help please help us.,Non-Political," What the fuck



All I can say is, get a lawyer, go to media. Contact local MLA. Drum up all the support you can get, but definitely contact media. They'll give your story visibility and shake up all those beaureaucrats. Why you morons down voting this guy? He needs serious help guys, please help him by up voting the post.

OP please post on r/LegalAdviceIndia as well. Upvoting for visibility MCD - Most corrupt department. I hope get serious help. File RTI and ask for copy of notice, copy of your payment proof, name of officers involved in sealing and person responsible for issuing the ?unsealing notice. Also ask for copy of file notings, dak register showing the dispatch of sealing notice issued to you. May also ask copy of relevant citizen charter, rules regarding timeframe of unsealing office after payment of penalty. Ask whatever you want in the RTI. I think you may also file it online in Delhi. Disclaimer:I am not a lawyer, use the strategy at your own risk,.... Doing business in this country is like going to a war. So many regulations, inspections, inspectors, penalties... Visibility. I don't have any idea how else can i help you. Bro, SC ka order aaya tha. Tab Delhi mein bahut saari properties seal hui thi. Jinke contacts the, unhone to de-seal karva li. Mostly logo ne 1-2 lakh rupee diye the. 

I think aapke koi contacts nahi hai, tabhi aapne itne rupee bhi de diye or de-seal bhi nahi hui. Pata karo bhai. Jin logo ki properites de-seal hui hai, unse pucho. Best hoga, agar kisi bade MCD official se jaan-pechan nikal aaye to kaam ho jayega. 

I think RTI lagoge, to seal ka notice mil jayega. 

Court bhi ja sakte ho, but wo to bahut lengthy process hota hai. Contact a lawyer and instead of filing a civil case (which will go on and on), seek advice on filing a writ petition in Delhi High Court - the lawyer will do the needful by invoking Fundamental Rights and all the good stuff.  

And do not worry. Things will be okay. Writs work faster than Civil cases. 

I hope a writ case is made out. Why don't you open the factory and start working? If they object ask them to show the notice that it is sealed? I would have said file a case in court but that’s going to be civil case it’s going to drag on for decades. Get someone influential and get your work done.

Can you not move your factory elsewhere?"

I hope to never see that again. [deleted] Few years back  when Cobra Post was doing sting operations on various celebrities there were some people who refused to spread communal propaganda for money Vidya Balan was one of those few people. The news coming out of 2020 India increasingly looks like the news coming out of 1990s India

Minus the economic optimism of the 1990s [removed] We all know what the guy meant let's have dinner 😑😑 Mr. minister, why should Vidya Balan invite you for dinner with her? You don’t seem to fit any criteria of either a gentle or a handsome man! 

Classic moron- when a woman turns you down, blame, shame and harass her. Right? BJP ? Looks like this piece of shit keeps behaving inappropriately on a regular basis. Looks like he had hit on another bjp leader's wife in 2013 and made sexist remarks against other women as well.

nixyab,,Art by Sandeep Adhwaryu,Politics," Hospital is a Western concept, no need to fund it. We are okay with quacks and prayers only. /s

Edit:- Thanks for the award, Anon! Whats the fourth drawing from the top? 2017 finance act and Electoral bonds scheme : Donations to political parties made opaque. Contributors' identity hidden from IT dept by law. Corruption made official and beyond the reach of law.

2018 : RTI act diluted by amendments that exempted many financial dealings of the govt from RTI queries. Most of the exempted dealings are to do with budgetary spends that have absolutely nothing to do with ""national security"" or ""sensitive state secrets"" that are usually quoted to hide the ruling party's corruption.

Round tripping of tax evaded black money with corporates : Adani was caught by ED in 2013 hugely over invoicing imported equipment for Adani Power and the enquiries by Ahmedabad ED office revealed a trail of thousands of crores of rupees travelling from India to shell companies in tax havens such as Mauritius and then coming back to Adani as ""foreign investments"" without tax liability ! After 2014, there has been no further development on this ED case. More importantly, the ED or the DRI have not made any further moves to investigate round tripping of corporate profits for evading tax.

2015 : The Rafale scam takes place
2019 : A pliant CJI (Gogoi) decides that the SC will not examine the deal by only saying that it does ""see any reason"" to examine it and by remaining deafeningly silent about the many incriminating evidences in the case !!

2020 : In 6 years, the Modi govt writes off 7.8 lakh crore rupees from the NPAs of public sector banks ! This is more than 3 times the amount written off by the UPA govt in 10 years. More pertinently, the Modi govt refused to table the list of top 100 defaulters in parliament, a list prepared and sent to it by the RBI !

The Centre for Media Studies, New Delhi (that surveys and monitors actual election expenditure of various political parties) has found and published data that the BJP spent more for its 2019 LS election campaign than the combined election campaign expenditure of the 2 major parties in the world's richest nation (USA) for the 2016 Presidential election !

Unprecedentedly very high election campaign expenditure (only a small part of which is reported to the Election commission) is the most glaring evidence for how extremely corrupt Modi's BJP has been all these years and gives a powerful pointer to where much of the written off NPAs have gone. #Source: [Sandeep Adhwaryu](https://mobile.twitter.com/CartoonistSan/status/1396091509187907591) Brother we needs docs to not just hospitals

Govt did not bother",Politics," Pendulum Swami in full form Swamy on the warpath .... I don't actually know anything about this guy but a quick wiki aticle suggests he has a track record for being a good BJP bhakt before that he was prof. at IIT Delhi, so what is this ? like is the wiki article outdated i.e. has he changed ? For weeks, there was news of oxygen shortage in Karnataka in 2020. This was in the regional media. If the national media had picked up that story and magnified it then, more people might have been aware of the problem, and someone might have done something about it. Instead their Delhi and north India focus blinded them to a problem that has now struck the entire country months later. Here is an example from Texas, a state with about 30 million people. 

https://www.dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/immunize/vaccineallocations.aspx

It lists on a weekly basis, how much vaccines are allocated to each provider, hospital, clinic, etc.. 

This is the kind of clear, simple information that Delhi should be maintaining when it comes to oxygen and vaccines. Put all the information, transparently, out there, and let the people monitor where the problem lies. Isn't Swamy from BJP huh? Swami will say shit and then go back to supporting the Govt. Quit it or fix it. Don’t moan about it while you enjoy your Govt perks and paraphernalia Trouble in paradise? Now I can totally see why this guy is not a Minister or to be exact finance minister ,This guy went and taught Economics in Harvard. Most of the time he is unhinged.   BJP uses him to needle opposition parties mostly. Sometimes he bites them back and hence he is not given any formal portfolio. He is a  loose cannon of sorts. I like this guy actually.

io1mza,,No Country for Women Art by @mirsuhail,Politics," The narrative around the Sushant Singh Rajput case has shown how alarming the situation of mental health is in india. The fact that news channels continue to nurture ignorance on mental health by sharing images of SSR being happy and joyful is concerning. And the worst part is, Rhea, who was probably grieving his death too, is being crucified in all of this.

Also, it's sad how the death of SSR is a political issue when it should not have been. Guilty or not, man or woman, no one needs should be hounded this way. Also, I don't understand how can police not do simple barricading. [deleted] I have already planned to get settle in Norway or England in the future.I'm done with mindset of the people over here.I don't see bright future for India in the next 50 years.

https://twitter.com/Runjhunsharmas/status/1302825327442493442/photo/1 Bihar BJP youth cultural wing has put the poster of Sushant Singh Rajput. It all seems political now. The case will drag till the Bihar election is over.

I can't even imagine what this women must be going through. More Bollywood celebs need to stand for this bias media coverage. SSR family has actually destroyed his image. Appreciation for the artist. Well put work. His family and specially sisters are messed up:
1) his dad comment about “mannat” to have a boy after 4 daughters - define lot about his family mental status.. these kind of people never can accept a independent females with their own mindset.
2) how much has SSR shares his assets with his sisters- they looked more worried about his property than his death.
3)his sister based in US seem to be prompting herself more than the real issue.- self claimed intellectual lady as she is based in US - claimed Rhea is into black magic.
The whole family mindset is screwed up. All I know is SSR is not at peace Sushant's death is an aweful tragedy. But this crucifixion of Rhea wouldn't be what he have ever wanted. Whatever be the scenario, this is something you don't even wish upon your worst enemies, left alone someone you were close to. This is beyond immoral and its disgusting that the media was left to do this charade without anyone questioning their actions. Law and Justice should be carried out by the system, not by paid, immoral, rating seeking scavengers. They are not journalists, they are scavengers."
n5870g,,"61% upset, angry over govt’s handling of Covid-19 second wave: Survey",Politics," Still only 61%? What are the rest of the 39% happy with?? Trust me, this crisis still hasn’t woke many bhakts up. They are busy posting “I stand with Modi”. There are many relatives I want to punch in the face right now to see if that wakes them up. 61%? More like hundred percent of those who can think rationally I think this pandemic has basically revealed the true reality of India to those upper middle class city dwellers and 'patriotic' NRIs. All that talk of ""rising superpower"", ""economic powerhouse"", ""pharmacy of the world"", etc was just pure, unadulterated BS. The reality is that India is still a poor, third-world country on par with Sub-Saharan Africa, and probably will remain so for many more years (if not decades) to come.

The people who spent their entire lives so far living in air-conditioned high-rises, who are now scrambling from pillar to post trying to find oxygen for their loved ones, are now realising this. In India, it doesn't matter how well-to-do or high-class you feel you are, the fact is you're only a small stroke of misfortune away from being on the pavement and begging for scraps, just like those poor sods you pass by on your car every day. And who are the rest 39% really? Chutiya janta ko chutiya leaders hei deserve karte hain.  The other 39% are daft cunts who jerk off to Modi and call anyone who has differing views an anti-national. Awww.... Tired of HinduMuslimMandirMasjid? Seeing your loved ones die coz of genocidal daddy? I hear you! I mean the 61% in survey are probably 6.1% of the actual population. Majority of India is still not tht connected on internet. And they make all the voting difference!! And that 39% is more than enough for BJP to come to power once again. So, I assume the rest of 39% are either dead or bhakts? 39% is enough to win elections. In 2019, BJP had 37.36% of votes.


BJP does not need to give a damn about the ""whinings"" of the 61%"

j4yqdh,"Summary of bans till now:

# Youtube accounts:

# Channel number 1,  named 'WhiteHat Sr'.

# 7 vides were removed from this channel.

* The only video which has been reinstated till now is of a balloon with WhiteHatJr and Byjus written on it, titled 'Difference between WhiteHatSr and Byjus'. In no way there were any copyright infringements in this video. You can find the video on my youtube channel or twitter (@WhiteHatSnr). So now Aiplex or Byjus won't apologize for removing the video? Just like that, they can remove anyone's videos?
* For the rest of the video, youtube rejected my appeal stating ' *Thank you for your counter-notification. Unfortunately, it's unclear to us whether you have a valid reason for filing a counter-notification, so we won't be able to honor your request.*  One of the videos which was removed was a screen recording of my phone, where I click on Google Play, open whiteharJr app, and check its reviews, the third and fourth videos were exactly the same, word to word. That's the video, hardly 30 seconds, no background music or commentary. Yet it was removed for 'CopyRight Infringements'.

# Channel number 2, named 'Safed Topi Sr 2'.

# 7  videos were removed from here.

* Videos were removed for reasons such as 'WhiteHatJr logo is shown on top left corner of the screen'. So I uploaded the same video with its entire screen blurred. And that video was also removed by WhiteHatJr for copyright Infringements.
* In one video I show every 5-star fake review of WhiteHatJr app on GooglePlay Store. This video getting banned seems so strange because I am showing fake reviews on Google Play Store which Google itself should not allow in the first place, and then their own Sibling company Youtube removes video. And then also rejects all my counter-notification stating I don't have any valid reason.
* Wolf Gupta video: This kid does not exist. And WhiteHatJr keeps changing his age from 9-14 years old and his salary from 1.2 crore rupees to 20 crores and then 150 crores. And this Wolf Gupta supposedly works in Google. So when I make a video on this, instead of taking any actions against WhiteHatJr, Google (YouTube) removes my video. Now Byjus higher mgmt says if Google/Barak Obama/Blue Origin/Elon Musk/Bill gates etc doesn't have any issue in whitehatjr using their pics, who am I to say anything. Well, its the public who is getting fooled with false advertisements, Elon Musk doesn't have time to look into WhiteHatJr ads!
* Videos on this channel got removed with in 30-45 minutes of getting uploaded. The entire channel was banned permanently so fast that I didnt even get time to file appeal for some of the videos.

# Channel number 3, named 'Pradeep Poonia 3.0'.

# Three videos have been removed from here till now.

* Some people suggested that my videos were getting removed because I used WhiteHat name. So I left that name after the second channel itself. And used my own name in this third channel. Here also videos are getting removed. One more strike, this channel would also be gone.
* The 'CLOUD' video is also removed. Hope you guys will make sure that that Cloud video always stays up in 'Cloud'.

# Two Reddit accounts

# 

1. u/whiteHatSr : permanently suspended for 'Harassment'. Ironically the post from this account was 'Byjus is Harassing me. Please help')
2. u/WhiteHat_Sr : here the post was 'My first Reddit account got suspended'.

&#x200B;

# Quora account

was temp suspended for 14 days for commenting a couple of answers. The account has no whiteHat anything in it, it was many years old personal account.

&#x200B;

# First Twitter account

@ WhiteHatSr was suspended suspiciously. Then I made an account @ WhiteHatSnr.

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think a total of 16 videos have been removed by now. I have tagged Youtube India on twitter asking explanations. They are ignoring all my tweets. Please support those threads on twitter (@ WhiteHatSNR)

After these videos of many other YouTubers are also taken down like its nothing.

Byjus is totally controlling the internet, especially Quora, Youtube, and where we are right now. I had been trying to post this for a week.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's next?

Some good things are happening behind the scene. Those will be revealed soon. Also, I will keep on uploading the videos on youtube on new channels. Support from you people would really help the cause.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They literally couldn’t come up with something more believable [deleted] They're doing more censorship than even govt lol Just a tiny bit of advice:

I know YouTube is unfairly removing your videos, but, when you do make a new channel, take care to not upload any of the videos from the other channels which got banned. They'll be much faster in taking action against the new one. 

Make new videos. And as others said, *always* stick to objective facts, with reputable sources. Make sure they're just quotes. Never quote any opinions, especially negative ones. Just present the cold hard truth, and leave the viewer to decide for themselves.


PS: can you explain what exactly whitehat jr and byjus are doing? I'm not in their target audience, so I don't get such ads, nor am I aware of the shit they do. Thankyou man for all your hardwork. I also didn't estimate correctly how deep WhiteHatJr is actually. A small kid (brother of my friend) who does not even know much about computers was taking their class (trial). He didnt believe me when I showed him your videos :(

Their advertisement it too strong. People are looking towards their advertisements and fake promises.

Its their advertisement, till the time its there, they will stay in power

And sadly all companies like reddit, twitter, etc are taking their side.

And probably your post will be removed as well :( This guy is on whitehatjrs ass for i dont know how long..lol ..i like it...have my upvote sir....fuck whitehat.

iwwqmf,,Historic Farm Bills,Politics," To be fair the aim is getting better. The first one was in the neck the second on the forehead. The third might hit the apple. So from what I've gathered, in pujab & haryana, the arhatiyas or the middlemen (who are mostly farmers themselves or own large tracts of land) and the state government make about 8-9% revenue in commission from sale to the apmc mandis. So I understand they have a lot to lose in terms of moolah and are agitating against the bills.

But what I want to understand is if any other state apart from punjab & haryana in India would be hit hard? Because otherwise this seems like a win for the poor farmers everywhere in the country who would get a chance to compare the prices offered to them by private traders and make an informed decision after comparing it with the already existing MSPs offered by the apmc mandis, and in turn selling their produce to whoever offers a better price. 

Punjab & haryana's extra pocket money is fucked for sure. And other state governments stand to lose a little bit of revenue from their agriculture sector.

So now the question is who should we be really siding with here:

Farmers.
Middlemen.
Or the state government? 🤣🤣

Good cartoon this one!

There could also have been 'the nation' as the target with the arrow saying 'lock-down' and the apple being  'covid-19' As a farmer, fuck the middlemen

But
As a farmer, I’ve been avoiding them when I can Anyway so this is just optics. 

Farming should be deregulated and food prices should find their free market levels. Everything y’all buy is the result of ridiculous subsidies for govt cronies. I do think that this time modi has done something good. But nothing stops the opposition from making the bill fail spectacularly. They can just refuse to accept goods from other states or let their goods be sold to other states. Agriculture is in state list. You forgot to mention about the Historic situations in the country (pandemic and issues with china) This bill has its own pros and cons but one of biggest flaw or con in this bill is that farmers now can't go to civil court. They will have to go to SDM. Therefore increasing bureaucracy will lead to more corruption. And most of the farmers will not get justice. This cartoon has half truths written all over it lol.

It's so clear that the APMC will still operate and mediate parellely with a system which involves direct transaction between farmers and consumers.

So no Satish Acharya,  stop pushing fuckshit narratives and half truths for leftist PR points.

The fuckin irony of this cartoon is that the Wire and Shekhar Gupta have gone on to appreciate these agri reforms. Brilliant ! This guy is awesome ! the apple should be ""doguni aamdani"""

Yesterday, [ICC announced BYJU'S as](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/icc-announces-byjus-as-global-partner-until-2023/articleshow/80745669.cms) [global partner until 2023](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/icc-announces-byjus-as-global-partner-until-2023/articleshow/80745669.cms).

Are you guys ok with BYJUs written all over, especially on the Indian Cricket team's T-Shirt? I am not.

if (you don't know about the case) {

>*BYJUs recently bought a startup called WhiteHatJr for $300M. This startup was really suspicious. Their false advertisements, sales pitch, curriculum. Everything seemed to have issues in it. In Sept 2020, When I looked deeper I found many issues. I decided to write about it on Quora and Reddit. Soon my accounts were suspended. So I moved to YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn and soon those accounts were also taken down. In total 17 videos, 2 YT channels, 2 Twitter handles permanently suspended, 3 articles from LinkedIn, the LinkedIn account itself was suspended twice, and these are just my accounts. 100s of other's accounts were taken down by BYJUs and WhiteHatJr ORM team.*  
>  
>*WhiteHatJr and Byjus tried their best to take down all my content from the internet and when I kept on making new accounts, they filed a $2.75M defamation lawsuit over me. Please google search ""Pradeep Poonia WhiteHat Jr"" to know more about the case, you will find a lot of news articles, videos, and posts regarding the same.*  
>  
>*The case is still in Delhi High Court, the next hearing is on 9th April. They have a lot of money and a bunch of lawyers to drag this case for years while I become penniless. In the first hearing, they got India's ex-Attorney General of India, Mukul Rohtagi to represent them.*

}

BYJUs is notorious for taking down dissent from the Internet, manipulating Quora and google play reviews, inhumane work culture in their offices, pushing poor parents into loan traps, creating issues for parents in refunds, the list goes on and on. Earlier Sahara India used to sponsor BCCI, which turned out to be a big fraud. Then I think KingFisher was also for some time sponsoring some cricket teams in IPL. And now this BYJUs.

When we watch cricket we generate value. Our viewership is valuable. We help brands make money. Shouldn't we have a little say in who gets to sponsor ICC or BCCI? It would be much more fun to watch cricket if even the brands printed on cricketers T-shirts are some good ethical brands we trust and like, it would be more fun to support teams that way. Why is the that it's mostly a scam which gets to get printed on T-shirts?

PS: I did a very polite comment under Anurag Dahiya's (Chief Commercial Officer of international cricket council) LinkedIn post saying we don't like seeing Byjus everywhere while watching cricket. And guess what, just like Byjus, he also deleted my comment.

I have started a petition on changeDotOrg. Link in the comments. Please do sign it. Together we really can make a difference.

Thank you.

Pradeep Poonia.",How do you feel about BYJUs Logo on the Indian Cricket team's T-shirt? They filed a $2.75M defamation case over me.,Business/Finance," Trust me on this one, your one single signature will make a difference. Share this petition in your friend circles as well please.

Why did hitler hate the learning app?
Cause it was made by jews.

On a serious note, lets keep fighting, victory would be ours. Idk why rich parents are the ones who do the most bullshit. Extra tuition should be either free or not allowed because this really ruins it for the poorer folks.

Edit: most of yall completely missing the point. Tuition classes (not all) take huge sums which only rich parents can afford. Now the rich kids learn and shit and poor kids are left behind. 

Not saying rich kids stop studying. But lets make tuition inclusive for all. Government regulates fees or takes in better staff at schools and pays them more. Just today I saw an ad of byjus partnering with disney targeting kids in 3rd std I would suggest that you should contact media, They can help you by spreading about this scam... I do not watch or bother with Byjus team. It is a private team playing on behalf of a corporate. They misled viewers that they represent a nation. Just like Sant Ram Rahim has 100 million followers across globe, their private firm has too. Let them be with 100 million teenagers fans. You do not have to waste your life following them once you gain maturity and understand the fakeness behind the scenes. You are getting targeted by Byjus now. Stay careful out there! i have personal hate for Byjus... i was offered role senior software engineer last year, i wash supposed to join on april 10th , but due to lockdown i couldnt, every other company will give a proper answer and plan to people who are yet to join. I called HR many times.. all she said was we are taking all efforts to send out new offer letters... after June they didnt reply to any of mail... but only after novemeber i came to know that they had not given out offer letter to many people, and suspended the hiring for them... luckly i had not put my resignation, so i didnt lose much.. but i hear many had left their job and where verge of joining them.. so .. Fuck Byjus. Now this is getting out of hand.
Byju's is a private company and so is BCCI. People are delusional and think BCCI represent India. It's a deal between two private companies. You don't have to go against everything they do"
jix6as,,Male govt employees who are single parents now entitled for child care leave,Non-Political," [deleted] Finally, India needs more gender neutral laws Sad that other fathers are not allowed leave. There should be parental leave for both.  Male government employees raising a child alone are now entitled to Child Care Leave (CCL), Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Monday. The provision and privilege of CCL will be available only for those male employees who happen to be ""single male parent"", which may include those who are widowers or divorcees or even unmarried, he added.

*Summary generated by [sansa](https://sansa.news/c/?i=31ecd4)* Great step. When i was in 9th class, i knew a boy who's mom was dead, had 3 younger siblings and a single dad, and they were on the poorer side. His dad worked as a cook in govt military mess, used to return home after midnight everyday.

One day our teacher called the boy at the front of the class, told us that he plays the role of ""mother"" for his 3 younger siblings and his depressed dad, cooks 2 meals a day for his siblings, and told us that we should think about him and his immense strength, try to put ourselves in his place before doing any idiotic thing or complaining about not getting the latest phone and stupid breakups.

I hope this law relaxes the lives of kids like him and his dad. I'm sure there are many more people like this. Nice Nonsense. Married men deserve child care leave as much as  a single parent. Nice imagine having more progressive laws than USA lmao Raising a child is one of the many aspects of unpaid domestic labour performed primarily by women - but this unpaid labour isn't just about spending time with them - it is also includes the domestic labour involved in maintaining a home. Statistically men in India perform some of the lowest amounts of unpaid domestic labour in the world - a detailed breakdown in India Today is [here](https://www.indiatoday.in/diu/story/less-than-10-percent-indian-men-involved-household-chores-survey-1731199-2020-10-13), and shows that **less than 15% of men actively participate in child care in urban areas (32% in rural)**. See additional reports in [Quartz](https://qz.com/184414/its-true-indian-men-hardly-do-any-housework/), [TOI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indian-men-spend-a-mere-19-minutes-a-day-on-housework/articleshow/31636967.cms). 

Hopefully moves like this will help shift the burden of domestic labour and not become an additional vacation for men - so that child-rearing and domestic labour can be shared between parents. This will allow more women to participate in the labour force. Additionally, it's also a good move, because it reduces the rationale often used to disallow promotions / employment to women because employers claim maternity leave will affect their competitiveness. Now that parental leave is equally applicable to men, hopefully this nonsense argument will be set aside.

Edit: downvote all you want, the reality doesn't change. Any leave to make babies too ? Cool"

It's rare. Pre mature evacuation I honestly don't know how we are not at the top of covid Recently boarded a Seoul-doha flight.
Condition was same., Social distance has gone for a a toss everywhere..this is not an Indian thing. People really start unbuckling their seat belts and take their bags out of the overhead shelves within 10s of the flight touching down like?? It's not even docked, where tf are y'all gonna go? I make it a point to get out of the plane last. Wearing sunglasses. Coming out in slow motion. Like a kardashian... only poorer. उतर जा जल्दी पेंचो, नहीं तो टिकट का ज्यादा पैसा देना होगा. I usually let the fuckers around me to join this queue and continue reading my Kindle in my seat. I swear I have caught some faces looking silly. They are already in the plane together for hours probably. Why would this add any more risk? But on its own the behaviour is unnecessary. They can always wait in their seats for a few more minutes. Just got off an Indigo from kol to hyd. The flight had blocked seating on the middle seat, and when getting off, people got off row wise. Personally, I felt safe, as everyone had masks on at least, if not shield + mask."

Being able to ignore the parts of society that are not comfortable to examine is a privilege. This reality that we live may not necessarily be our fault, but we do have some responsibility for it. The point is not to make anybody feel guilty, guilt doesn’t do anybody any good, but to recognize that we have choices. We can either choose to keep our heads buried in the sand or we can choose to be involved in some way.

If you don't have to think about it, it's a privilege. This holds true for everything not just politics. This is good content People from the future will be embarrassed for our cruelty towards animals. Just like how we are embarrassed for misogyny, racism, castism, ignorance etc. of our past (present). Ootl, what's this about? #govegan [removed] What is the big deal about this? Dog needs 🍖. Chicken is a prey animal. Virtue signalling in top marks Virtue signalling by a previleged person. Thanks to people like you there is rise of populist attitude in the country. Good job!!"
n5y4bf,"I had a few friends and relatives who lay somewhere on the bhakt spectrum. Since around 2017, I had been getting increasingly disgusted by their politics, but tolerated them because of my memories of all the 'good ol' times' we'd had. All of them were pretty decent people prior to the Modi wave, and since none of them were saying outright hateful, bigoted things, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I thought of cutting them off during the CAA protests, but around that time I moved to a new place, so in the selfish fear of being lonely, I continued being in touch.

But I have finally taken the plunge after this Modi-made disaster. I can't do it anymore. I feel a bit guilty about taking so long to do this, because I feel I betrayed my Muslim countrymen just by tolerating these bigots, by never confronting them head-on. I didn't wait to check if these bhakts had turned off their bhakti after seeing this carnage. A few had been indicating that they were turning Modi-skeptic as he led rallies and let Kumbh Mela happen. But whatever, it's too late. They are all well-educated, very well-off people. They are sensible enough to know what news is more trustworthy, but they still read Swarajya, not Washington Post or the Wire. They CHOSE to swim in the fake-news ecosystem because they want to hate, they want to hear things that justify their hate. They could have chosen to stop supporting this cabal of incompetent bigots, but they didn't until the fires lit by BJP reached their homes. Even now, I'm sure, some of them remain supporters. One of them guessed I was ghosting him, and even complained of 'cancel culture' on my part!!

I'm glad that my parents and other close friends are liberal, secular, compassionate people. It's a liberating feeling to abandon terrible people - who were once good, but chose to turn into bigots.",I have cut off all my bhakts in my friends and family. I feel great!,Politics," I think this is a good thing for personal mental peace. But this just exacerbates the underlying problem which is that bhakts live in an echo chamber of other bhakts amplifying their beliefs and labels dissenters as ""Pakistani, paid by Congress, anti-nationals, mullas, etc...""

In the circle of bhakts among your family and friends, if there is a voice of opposition/resistance in that, they would know their beliefs are not the universal truth and everyone who disagrees with them is a Pakistani.

Easier said than done,  I know.... but .. just my two cents. Yeah. I did that in 2016 itself, when my so called friends/colleagues started calling me anti national and Khan market gang because I vehemently opposed Demonitisation on social media. 

I have been able to convince my parents about the issues with BJP and they are back to being rational and logical. I went the other way round. Some of my best friends were bhakts. They'd casually discuss bhakti stuff while we drank. I and another non-bhakt friend would either correct them or agree with them to a point of ridicule. E.g. when they talked about chips in 2000 notes, my friend added MP3 players and audio apparatus, for blinds, to those notes.
They started taking a turn when my cousin, who used to drive Uber in our city, got a job in Kolkata and also managed to find jobs there for his other friends. My friends slowly started realising that their WhatsApp forwards were wrong. It was during the Delhi riots that they completely converted. It so happened that one of our friends was from the area. He made it clear that it was kicked off by rumours floated by BJP WhatsApp groups.

Anyway, nothing has changed for me, as all these friends blame Modi for everything under the sun now and they now believe Mamta and Kejriwal are saints. Sigh I had a roommate (Hindu) when I(Muslim) was doing engineering. He was rajput, bjp bhakt and used to say a lot of disturbing things about Dalits and Biharis, don't know why. We used to debate on reservation and other topics. I always gave him the benefit of doubt and thought I can change his pov. Few years later I saw his status  on whatsapp on anti CAA protest calling  how muslims are terrorist etc etc. That was it.  I deleted his number and left his messages on seen. It's going to be a lonely slog. Surprising no one- people like this are ""nice"" except they prefer to believe the hate. And I'm not even from the North. I also cut ties with my cousin. When we were children, we used to eat in the same plate. Then our lives changed and I became a travel photographer. [She saw this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUrBwgL4xgc&t=1s) that I shot in Nagaland and started acting as if it was the most disgusting thing ever. Because these people don't dress like her and their rituals are not like her. She kept saying how disgusting, how disgusting. I got so pissed off that I left her place that same moment.

I have not spoken to her in last 2 years. Sometimes I feel that I should contact but I don't want to. Just feel so sad thinking that she is so bigoted.

Also, I remember, when we were children, hating on Muslims was a part of casual conversation which I only realized when I grew up and took up this profession. 

Then during a friend's Nikah, I met a college friend who talks a lot of shit about Muslims. I openly asked him that why he is here if he hates Muslims. He replied, that he only hates bad Muslims. But he got so embarrassed that he left the venue altogether. I felt so happy that I showed a bigoted person his place. 

I also broke a shaadi ka rishta after I realized that the girl was bigoted AF.

She asked me why do I have Muslim friends and I was so pissed off. She told me that I can't work with LGBTQ community and had problems with all the photos of Shaheen Bagh that I clicked back during protests. When we buy into fascism we betray not just our muslim countrymen, we betray our whole country. We betray the very idea of India and what it stands for. I have broken my friendship with a 15 year old friend. I just cant digest his Anti Muslim bigotry. there is a Laxman rekha and he cross that day when he celeberated Delhi riots. I am done with this all bhakts. Opposite take: all my close friends and family are bhakts. They know my position on this and we all have debates and arguments over Modi related issues all the time. But I have learnt to separate the two aspects and deal only with the opinion they voice instead of judging them entirely. Yeah I have had to listen to khangressi, aaptard and so on but I let them know that i will not engage if you use irrational labels. Same here. Cut the only Bhakt friend of mine after Farmer protest. He’s a PhD from a US university, not a WhatsApp university graduate. Can’t think of any reason (other than the obvious one) of him supporting BJP. Thats not how we build a society. If we start ostracizing people with different opinion then we will be creating another cult., causing a rift. I understand the situation that it might be hurting your sensibilities and mental health. Keep a distance, but please dont cut em off."

n0hfpo,,"Even though some are blinded, the rest of the country is watching.",Art/Photo (OC)," Depends on who are blinded and who are watching.

Our democracy is geared in such a way that if you can capture the entire Hindi belt, then you need not worry about 60-70% of rest of India. 

So as long as the big Hindi states are blinded by media or whatsapp or whatever,  that is good enough Old man doesn't deserve high quality art. The nation will rise one day and throw out this traitor I'm a strong believer of the idea that "" Devil created religion so that we may never find God"". This piece of shit is a Devils guy coz where ever he goes Death follows. Blinds are for horses, not for donkeys. Donkeys DGAF even without the blinds. I am shocked that today also some people's are defending the government.

This is most arrogant govt I have seen in my life. Don't worry, soon another SSR like case will be found and the pied piper will lead the rats away to another fake reality. A Panglassion ""best of all possible worlds"" where nothing can go wrong and if it does, we all know Nehru did it. We are a country that is driven by emotions. We then justify those emotions  by the facts that only WE want to accept, and not others.

These are our current emotions, Post Pandemic (especially. During elections) every single politician will try to instil a fresh set of emotions. It may be in the name of patriotism, sacrifice, by blame game or may be by fueling 'that remote hatred you have for a certain religion', through media and vague stories on social media.

That's more than enough to undo the facts.

But again, we are a country that has always come together as one community during crises.

P.S. Deepest condolences  to all those who have lost more than just time during  this Pandemic. Stay strong, this too shall pass. he is enjoying virtual reality where he is a king.....  Dead bodies in crematoriums are telling us more truth than dead souls on news channels Why do not Indians hold their politicians accountable? Looks like most of them are corrupt and get away with anything. From everything I am reading, current crisis is completely because of Indian PM and his party. Why do not people protest instead of wait for elections?"
kkexq3,,A shaded relief map of the Republic of India,Non-Political," Man UP is really flat Years ago, I used to live in Delhi and visit Mangalore during the holidays. Before Konkan railways was built, the only way to go from Mangalore to Delhi was to head south from Mangalore till Coimbatore, then turn East towards Salem, Erode, Chennai and then head north towards Vijaywada, Nagpur, Bhopal, Agra and Delhi. It used to take 3 days and this map explains why. The pass through Coimbatore Salem and Erode (also called the Palghat Gap) is the only low altitude pass between the west coast and east coast.  Nice and sleek! Can we get a version with the state lines overlaid too? The more you look at it, the more things make sense from a historical perspective. For example, if not for the western ghats I wonder if Kerala as a state or Malayalam as a language would have even come to existence. The onlytwo districts in Kerala with Tamil influence are Palakkad and Trivandrum, the two openings in the ghats. I looooove topographical maps. One of things on my bucketlist is to setup a company doing extremely localised 3D prints. [removed] Some of the state boundaries start to make sense when you see a map like this. I love this !

k9n0ew,,"25-year-old MP dalit touches food at a feast, beaten to death",Politics," [removed] Caste is India's most ancient social ill. It relies on convincing people that certain human beings are not equally human. Only when our society looks towards the work of the present and future instead of celebrating glorious and imagined pasts can it truly reckon with such things.

No one who truly acknowledges the millenia-long horror of caste can look at ancient India and imagine it to be a utopia. This is the reason why many politicians minimize and sweep caste-oppression under the rug. Their cherished narratives of returning to an Indian golden age (that was interrupted by Mughals and British) would fall to pieces. 

Over the last 2000+ years, such a story as this news article has repeated itself uncounted times with uncounted people. The past was never a rosy place. It was a difficult world with one or two bright spots. This is so so so fucking sad and depressing...

jl4904,,I made a drawing of Nirula's at Connaught Place New Delhi.,Food," Love it mate.

I remember going to Nirula’s with a report card to get a free ice cream Sunday. I dont know the place but still this looks so beautiful. You should record making these art pieces. Youll be famous in no time. So the year is 1998, I go to Delhi for participating in a quiz and we end up at Nirulas. I look at the menu, and a large softdrink catches my eye. Have a medium, my dad says. Ok, I say a bit disappointed.

That disappointment turns to awe when I see how big the medium coke really is. Then a question at the back of my head - if the medium is so ginormous, how huge is the large? And as if on cue, a person strides by my table carrying a huge fucking jug full of coke. Oh, I think, that's quite large. Nice! I’ll embrace my uncle-hood and buy you a hot chocolate fudge sundae as a reward for doing such nice drawing. Nice pen, man, my high school crush had an yellow Safari. The manhole covers out front is a nice touch and also realistic. It got replaced by a Dunkin right? Ohhh man this brings back so many memories. There was a Nirula's in Paschim Vihar my father used to take us all to. Loved the burger with the hash brown, the thin crust pizza, the hot chocolate fudge. But the best was their chhole bhature...

* **Fasal Bima** ( Crop Insurance ) : How many claims were paid off ? It just did the one thing which BJP is scarily good at **fill pockets of corporate insurance companies.**

* One of selling points is that he addressed Health hazards by building toilets under Swach Bharat mission ,Yes he did build toilets but 60**% of those toilets don’t have water** and You know what toilet without water is private *khet* !!.

The short term costs assumed a growth rate of 12% in 2019-20 which is stupid as it sounds and as expected, a more realistic growth rate of 7.2% was achieved. This messed up all calculations and the centre has been delaying GST payments to states now ([source ](https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/explained-the-issue-of-the-gst-compensation-to-states-6741931.htm)). Apart from the loss of financial independence to states and loss of the nation's federal structure, states are now financially ill-equipped to tackle Coronavirus pandemic. 

CAG Audits: Now routinely delayed and not put in the public domain ([source](https://m.thewire.in/article/government/state-cag-audits-fy-2019)). Also, 'PM Cares' equivalency with 'PM Afraid of Audits'. 

Fasale Bima: Touted as better than all the earlier crop insurance schemes, the target was 50% enrolment by 2018-19. But 2017-18 enrolments were dismal 26%, lower than 2015 levels. They tried to hide the 2018-19 data so picture is muddled, but coverage rate looks to have dipped further. This is classic BJP policy. Promise moon and stars, prepare a hasty scheme, screw up the implementation and leave the people worse off that before, hide the data. 

Employment: their efforts have been more towards hiding the employment survey data ([source](https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/india-unemployment-rate-6-1-per-cent-45-year-high-nsso-report-1539580-2019-05-31)) than providing the employment itself. 

Poverty: They also hid the poverty data from 2017-18 consumer expenditure survey when it showed that poverty rates have increased after 40 years. After huge uproar and petitions, a report was released but the data is still hidden. There has been no detailed survey on poverty rates since 2011 in this country now. ([source ](https://scroll.in/latest/944431/consumer-spending-angus-deaton-thomas-piketty-200-other-academics-seek-immediate-release-of-data)). Indirect estimates show that mass poverty is back after 1970s ([source](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/governance/mass-poverty-is-back-in-india-76348)) He does not deserve this hate. They all deserve more Gst is such a shit show. Everyday a new rule. They want to match everything in real time, which is impractical. So much changes in return has caused havoc. If mismatch occurs, boom ITC denied. Basically they've created every possible situation to deny ITC and make the businessmen pay double taxes as far as possible. They are sucking money in the name of gst. 

Being in this field, I feel vat was much better. It would've worked better with tuning and uniformity. Gst has benefitted only the IT company handling it and the big businesses.

Edit: And the States are left with no power and means to generate revenue. Basically they are handicapped. And don't get me started on the late fees and interest. 

In the period of lockdowns, state go to lockdowns at different periods, but the returns have to be filed. Now if state had control, they could've given some exemption, but it is the centre controlling entire India, although they've given some but it is not in sync with lockdown periods. Aaaa fuck this!!! Modi is a hate monger. He deserves more than hate. There's a special place in hell reserved for bastards like him Gst is supposed to help everyone but in reality it fucked everything even more.

Govt can't reduce price of oxygen cylinders or even remove gst from them because the gst system is built in such a way that manufacturer can claim rebate if he doesn't pay gst.

So govt has to remove gst from all the raw materials which is an impossible task so they just left it open. Remember Narendra is only the Face.

Do people deserve to pay high price for petrol, diesel and LPG when they can't get employment due to pandemic?

ji7rga,,"""Improve Economy Instead Of Toppling Governments"": Uddhav Thackeray To BJP",Politics," Economy ??

out of syllabus topic !!! I laughed when he said, ""Drink your gau-mautra and keep quiet"" It is gladdening to see how Uddhav has come on his own, and set the Shiv Sena on an independent course after he famously declared in front of a public gathering that [the Sena rotted during their alliance with the BJP](https://www.ndtv.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-rotted-during-alliance-with-bjp-uddhav-thackeray-1436259). History of people behind the Sena and allied movements like the Maharashtra Unification, like Prabodhankar Thackeray (Uddhav's grandfather),  is testament to the fact that their aim was to establish a reformist and progressive state and community. Sample this:

> At a time, when love before marriage was a social taboo, he got dozens of youngsters married. If the shock of ‘love marriages’ was not enough for the society, Prabodhankar ensured inter-cast marriages took place without any opposition.


> Through organisations like Swadhyay Ashram and Govindagraj Mandal, Prabodhankar fought against the social evil of dowry. He would hold protests with donkeys outside wedding venues, where dowry was accepted. He would force the groom to return the dowry to the bride’s father.


> Prabodhankar was a Hindutva-wadi, but his Hindutva was diagonally opposite to that of RSS for two reasons. One, he was a “rationalist” in a limited sense, as he opposed religious rituals by Brahmins or anyone. Two, his followers call him the father of “Bahujan-wadi Hindutva” as it’s the Hindutva sans Brahminical dominance.

> When he wanted a Dalit to perform pooja at a Ganpati pandal at Dadar, traditional Brahmins opposed it. So, he started public Navratri at Dadar. Initially, it was a non-Brahmin affair, but now everyone celebrates it across Maharashtra.

Source - [The Original Thackeray: 7 Things About Prabodhankar You Must Know. Many don’t know that Bal Thackeray’s father was a social reformer, a political activist and an eminent author.](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/the-original-keshav-thackeray-7-things-about-prabodhankar-you-must-know-shiv-sena-bal-thackeray-hindutva-ambedkar) They are literally recommending 'Swadeshi' at this point, in 2020. What was the point of bashing 'Nehruvian Socialism' for this many years then? To promote import substitution in the end?

Also remember how Modi was hyped in the neoliberal media back in 2014-15? ""Woah. India has finally gotten a man who means business. At last the country's potential will be unleashed."" etc etc. Then he went ahead and did demo. At least outside India, no one has ever brought up his economic acumen ever since.  Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said there would be anarchy in the country if the BJP remained interested only in toppling governments rather than improving the nation's economy. ""Rather than working on improving economy, steps are taken to topple governments. We are heading towards anarchy,"" he added. He dared the BJP to topple his 11-month-old government and also asked it to protect its government.

*Summary generated by [sansa](https://sansa.news/c/?i=1895c1)* We gonna whitewash Shivsena now?Seriously? As the days are going uddhav led gov. seems much mature than many cm we got over the years. I love his rationalist view dispites of his hindutva ideology. Thats what shivsena is. Bal Thackeray may have founded shivsena but uddhav is the son who has found true meaning of it. The party was built to progress maharashtra and to give voice to marathi people. This was there aim. Good to see someone standing to bjp gov. its now either you unite and stand against modi government to stop them from becoming complete authoritirian gov. Or become one of them. We already have one example of UP gov. Lets see how bihar turn out now. Wouldn't be surprised if Tejaswi Yadav win dispite being the son of lalu yadav. We don’t do that here 5 trillion Dollar 🤑. Udhav Thackeray statements are on point and it is good see opposition taking a stand. This guy definitely knows how to shut up BJP. Seriously i don't care if he believed in extreme Hinduism before taking charge Chief minister office. The changes in ideology even for CM post are just amazing. Economy? What's that?"

Over the years I have seen many succumb to their narrow perspectives and beliefs to the extent that their thinking becomes rigid. Most folks didn't see BJP as the harbinger of the darkness we as a nation would have to walk through when they came to power back in 2014. It was time that taught us how wrong and prone to manipulattion we really are. We often blame lack of education as the biggest reason for bad faith politicians winning elections but if we are really being honest, it's this constant need for a messiah figure to rescue us from our miserable conditions. We have become a people who hate subjugation but also secretly crave it. We feel incabale of self determination or charting a solid inclusive path for us. This whole idea that was propogated by Godi Media ""If not Modi then who?"" in a country where majority of govts. formed have been coalition governments in nature and it spread like wildfire. How did that happen in a country where a communist party and a non-left party formed a govt not long ago? And so, Time has brought us back to square one where we are now rethinking our allegiances and biases. So I want you all to think about a person, celebrity, political party, public figure, religion, field of work or whatever you are a fan of and do three things:

1. **Tell us why you were a fan/follower/die-hard supporter.**
2. **Why you are still a fan/follower or if you aren't anymore then what changed your mind?**
3. **Take a pledge to never blindly follow or be a die hard fan of said person/party/ideology etc**

You can do those in whichever order you like but those three should be written in bullet points. Feel free to add more if you want to leave any footnotes or stories that made you question your beliefs. We all benefit from each other's learnings.

How bad can it possibly be Trying saying /s at the end of your sarcastic comment. I had a friend who was very sarcastic. I found him downright condescending at times. But as we interacted more over the years we became best friends. He was a kind person at heart. As time passed everyone in the friend circle understood his sarcastic behavior and it was not a problem anymore. He explained his situation that he doesn't make friends easily but when he does he they last forever.

I feel you can acknowledge being sarcastic once you realized that your comment made someone uncomfortable. Further, try to consciously see the situation where your such comments are not welcome e.g. particularly when you are in the initial phase of interactions.

I have used past tense for my friend not because we ceased to be friends but because he is no more. ""loose lips sinks ships"" is a famous saying and in your case it has already sunk some relation*ships*. It's good that you are self aware of this. Half your battle is already won. I guess just thinking twice before speaking would help. I method I use is to take a pause and quickly count from 1-5 or a deep breath the moment I know I'm about to say something I will regret. That 0.5s is all your brain needs to change its mind. If the topic has to be spoken, then you now have the opportunity to reword it. Self control. If you really want to change it, you have to will yourself enough to NOT say it out loud. Think about your lowest times, if people mocked you instead of supporting you, how would you feel? This is the same (even if people aren't in their lowest), they just DON'T appreciate and you should respect. If there are others who can take it, use it with them, but not with the ones who've expressly made known their displeasure. It's the same as people using an offensive nickname for you (which annoys you), expect it's your sarcasm instead of your nickname"

I'm self employed. And every idea he had about new entrepreneurs and things he talked about made so much sense. I think he can be a very good leader.

***Vipassana***

Vipassana is what Buddha taught all his life and shared the benefits. I wish to share these benefits with you all. Designed for anyone and everyone regardless of their nationality, language, culture etc. this technique is the exact practical teaching of Budhha's. THIS is what he taught.

Some sources for its whats and whys.

Another interesting documentary: [Doing time, doing Vipassana (Tihar jail)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaMFiizeJVE)

Vipassana was bought to India in late 60s by [S.N.Goenka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._N._Goenka) who was a Burmese businessman. Having experienced the benefits he started a revolutionary movement to teach this very scientific technique to anyone and everyone who wanted to learn. Personally having experienced it, when you know the kind of peace it can achieve you, you want everyone to experience the same peace.

There are hundreds of Vipassana centers all over the world and next week I will be going to my first international center in [Lutirano](https://atala.dhamma.org/), small town near Florence to serve a 10 days course as a volunteer. I have practiced it for 10 years as an adult and few years as a child (there are children and teenager courses). These courses are available in most Indian languages and also most International languages. There are teachers who are trained for years and must have certain amount of change to show in them through their practice. Teachings, servings, volunteering, courses, accommodations etc everything is free of cost for new and old students. The entire operations runs through donations and charity.

I urge you all to have a look at this technique, maybe give it a try and hopefully it brings you some peace and happiness.

Mangal ho!

(How I found about it: My late grandfather started practicing in early 80s suggested through his lawyer who won him a very stressful case in SC. Naturally he introduced it to the family. My late grandmother and mother were very ardent. Both my grandparents then spent about 20 years teaching all over India. In above tihar jail documentary, there were 60 teachers invited from all over India and my grandfather was one of the teachers who helped teach many students in tihar. My mother introduced my father soon after they married, and being a man of science he studied with critical interest and approved upon complete research. My sister and I were introduced as early as my mother's pregnancy. We started home practice at early age and I attended first course of 3 days at the age of 4 (I couldn't really tie even my shoeslaces).  About 10-12 years ago my mother started teaching 10 days courses. This year both my parents traveled to Dubai to teach a group of students, my father doesn't teach yet (He only retired a year ago, 2020 doesn't count) but he has been a very involved practitioner for 32 years. However, it was a lot of fun and stress to have my mother practice her English with my bf as he has most different accent to give her practice her communications. Their training took learning of ancient Pali language, which they studied together for years since 2012 and ancient literature and hundreds of books written about this technique (Dhammapad- the collection of books). I picked up a serious practice at age of 19, 10 years ago during a very disturbing time but I found immense mental peace here. Ever since I have been quite dedicated and I wish you all find the same benefits that I found. I will be experience serving as volunteer first time. My last course of attendance as a student was in August 2018 at [Gorai, Mumbai](https://www.globalpagoda.org/). My sister however has attended courses and served in centers in Boston, NY and very recently in California.)

The country is going in the shitters, because there are too many assholes. *Does Multi track drifting* Are we saying that people who voted for Modi are dumb and don’t know what they are doing? Good one. Though his approval rating is still above 60% (the last poll I saw) so not sure why it says only 38%. Seems like it is being confused with net approval, which is different from actual approval rating. Easy answer. Never tarnish Prime Minister Modi's image. Modi is god. Modi is love. Modi is life. He is the greatest. He will never give you up. He will never let you down. He will never turn around and desert you. He will never make you cry, or say goodbye. He won't tell a lie and hurt you.

nk3dw1,"I don't know how many of us know the kind of discrimination, and authoritarianism that is going on in the string of what once was a peaceful place. However in December 2020 Praful Patel was appointed as the administrator of the Islands due to the untimely passing of their then administrator Mr. Dineshwar Sharma, an IPS officer with a great track record. Normally most of these posts were generally administered by capable and sensible IAS/IPS officers. I respect them more than any of our slimy crooks who call our leaders. It is always them who do all the dirty work in the background and these guys who mostly cannot even hold a candle to the immense knowledge our IAS/IPS officers have, take all the credit. All the time.

So to replace the late Mr. Sharma, enter Praful Patel. Appointed by the PM himself. You see while the entire mainland India was fighting the coronavirus (by ourselves) (atma nirbhar) Lakshadweep was able to keep the virus under control with strict quarantine measures and proper management. The island even though part of India has its unique culture and the people are peace loving and 99% Muslim.

This is when Patel enters, gets people arrested for protesting the CAA and many of our PM's dumb moves. Bring up the gooda act!! bans beef, allows the sale of alcohol and worst of all one cannot stand for the election if they have more than 2 kids! 

I am not pro-Muslim or Anti-Hindu or anything of thst sort but to anyone who is connecting the dots, this is done with one thing in mind, destroy their culture, communities and their heritage which they have guarded since the beginning of time. If you have been trying to figure out what India might look like if these guys make it to rule again. What we see in Lakshadweep is a sample of what is to come. We need to stop this. This is against our constitution and it is time we unite atleast online and fight for them. They are one amongst us and they need our help. #savelakshadweep","Dear India, we need to save Lakshadweep (ലക്ഷദ്വീപ്)",Politics," Btw the same administrator was responsible for making many go  homeless in Daman. He is a scum. how can they ban beef where 99 percent are muslims? >this is done with one thing in mind

To create unrest, rile people up and take control while they're busy reacting. Sounds like another Kashmir. The case for Lakshadweep :

**Lakshadweep is a testing ground for future moves by Modi and Co.**

Existing situation is that citizens vote for local, state level and MP elections. With the increase of money spent on elections all three elections are now rigged/favored to the rich majority sides.  *This was going on for decades.*

**With BJP there is a grand new turn.** The elected candidates can be bought, not a few in number, but so large in number that the elected government can be dismantled. This has happened in Karnataka and MP, and was almost successfull in MH. So, evetually the government actually governing, is not elected by people. (Since they were not elected they are not responsible or answerable in any way. Future elections will be managed in a similar way with the use of money. PMCares is a big bank for this).

During this period they will dismantle the legislative assemblies and create reasons for creating union territory. This successfully happened in J&K. In total, the  power to choose the administration was lost and now people in J&K are just citizens witout any franchise (or maybe very limited electoral power).

Now comes the next step, J&K is a large area with varied conditions, and doing big moves is problematic. This is also true for other states where BJP will not be in power or losing power. While Lakshadweep being an island is an experimental ground for prohibitive measures  to test what is possible and what is not, without the dangers of neighboring country poking in. *This is speculation.*

You should consider that Lakshadweep in effect does have a limited electoral power. The citizens living there send one representative to the parliament (Now Mr. Mohammed Faizal PP), thus not affecting the number balance in the assembly to a big extent. Then the reason for excessively novel prohibitive laws and change of rules by a person appointed by Modi, should be seen with greater scrutiny. The administration was doing good job. Literacy in Lakshadweep is 92%, which is great. Wikipedia says ""*There is little economic inequality in Lakshadweep and the poverty index is low*"". This represent a well managed and efficient admin.

**The homogenization of India :** Indian states have a very varied culture and traditions. This means that a large effort and balancing - counter balancing was adopted by early goverments 1947-1970s to accommodate peoples ideas and opinions, particularly with regard to the Union territories. Some differences did exist but people moved on. This mean the rise of regional parties and local bodies. Now, a central totalitarian regime cannot manage all of this. So, the first step has been to remove the folds and remove differences ( like imposition of language and so on). I see the present move at Lakshadweep, as a direction towards testing moves/laws/rules/regulations  towards homogenizing people's culture and tradition. Maybe this is far-fetched but after demonetization and COVID mishandling, nothing is not possible under Modi.

You can see this happening in the mainland Hindu homes with the imposition of Ram, while we had millions of gods to look up to. ( Atheist here though) By the way... I missed what irritates me the most somehow in my write up... The kids who show up at the government schools are served a non vegetarian meal. However after this fool turns up there, the first thing he does is to ban that and have them served vegetarian meals. That is unacceptable!!! Who the fuck are these bastards to determine what those children eat? For that matter they are answerable for the logic behind each of these stupid laws that are passed in a place that has been peaceful, contained the virus really well and there has been no civil unrest or crimes reported from there. Heck, even the policemen and women are pretty jobless out there as the community is peaceful. Then why do you deen some dickhead like him to show up one day and fuck all up. I am sorry for my strong language. But I cannot help it for I am absolutely livid in embarrassment because of these colossal idiots, their ideologies and their stupidity. Oh geez. We should all spread the word. Our democracy is crumbling. Modi is a scum. The twat only cares about himself. What they did in Assam too. Draconian and arbitrary laws and, insensitivity to the culture they have arrived into. This is outrageous, thank you for speaking up about this in a very well mannered way!

Careerwise i am fucked because it's been almost 4.5 years since graduation and i have worked only for like ~3 years. Didn't really develop any considerable skills to get a new job. Even applying for jobs gives me stress as to how would i work in case i get selected, low self confidence you see :( 

I seem like a chill person (as many people have told me) but deep down i have insecurities as to what if people make fun of my inability and incompetence and so why would anyone want to befriend me. That's why i have stopped talking to my now ex-friends altogether. Having no one to share stuff with seems strange sometimes but then i remind myself of the plethora of reasons to be in this situation.

Future seems bleak. People whom i know are getting engaged, some married and here I can't even deal with my issues. Sometimes not being alive seems like the best way to get rid of all these issues. 

I don't know how far i can go like this but honestly this all seems like endless sufferings. Every day feels like hell. 

Is there anything i can do to get back on track and do something good with my life?

Edit: Thanks for the valuable tips/suggestions. Means a lot that you took time to write the much needed info. A lot of you have suggested taking therapy, i started therapy 3 weeks ago and it's going okayish do far. I am trying to work on my thoughts (CBT) as suggested by the therapist. Also, some have suggested doing physical activities and yes i surely will start doing some light workout and then gradually increase it. 

Edit 2: Those who are on the same boat, i pray that we would overcome all this someday for sure. Keep trying. Baby steps. :)",Been to rock bottom before but this time it feels like the dead end. Mid twenties and feels like life has come to an end.,Non-Political," take one day at a time.

do what you REALISTICALLY can do in that day to improve your life. it doesn't have to be big stuff but you have to start.
now this is cliche but think about things that you do have and let me tell you one thing, it isn't easy and it won't be. it definitely will get easier though.
continuing what you're doing is hard. but so will changing the things that you do want to change. 
it's all in your hand and it's your choice. 
allow yourself to heal and don't block your emotions, find an outlet. 
trust the process and try to look through your problems. and trust me when I say that it'll be alright. stop overthinking and comparing yourself. everyone has a different pace there's no competition. 
I truly hope that you feel better 
<3 >I seem like a chill person (as many people have told me) but deep down i have insecurities as to what if people make fun of my inability and incompetence and so why would anyone want to befriend me. 

If people find you chill, you are doing a good job at hiding the insecurities by default. Chill on that part, you are likable. Focus on job and career now. Like how your friends can't see your insecurity, the selection people won't be able to see it from your application. Don't hold yourself back n get into applications and studying.

27 is a young age, from my perspective at least. I was unemployed or rather between jobs during that period, and unsure on career. Then there was a time after that where I was working two jobs and preparing for exams. Don't think too much on where your peers are in terms of marriage and stuff, life is different for everyone. Your struggle is different and its important too, consider the rough times as character development for future. Also don't worry too much about driving, it might look scary but not something you can't do. 

Here is some thought process I used to keep during my rough days. These experiences are research for the future book I am going to write. Though silly, it kept me positive n going. Create an individual axiom like that and get working. Life won't stay the same brother, there will be good times. I am still not a success story but things did get better. If you feel like talking to someone, feel free to message. I'm almost your age and might have a few suggestions if you would like to chat? I've been and going through mental health issues as well. You are not alone. It's a pretty fucked up thing. It makes the easiest thing much harder. Even opening a gate in the restaurant is a challenge for me. There are so many what-if thing happens in mind. If there are girls around you, then multiply it by 10 times. 27 is still so young, there are lots of things you can try out to help get yourself back on track, you need to search & find the ones that work for you.  Reaching out here is a great start, some folk have given great suggestions.   Depression, anxiety, imposter syndrome, sucks big time!  I've had depression for some years now, plus other issues - I feel ya!.   Like mosquitos, you can just sit there being bitten going crazy itchy, getting malaria, or you can fight those fuckers!!  Don't give in to the black dog.   Take small steps, manageable bites.  Bit by bit, claw your way out!!

Exercise!  Search youtube & do a zumba session every morning to move the cogs & get you going.   Zumba is great, with the music.   Do your own art therapy, draw or sketch or paint or collage it out.  Draw some feelings, then make some kickass uplifting positive affirmation collage (even if you swear at it the whole time lol)  Print out in colour some good positive affirmations & stick them on your wall / somewhere you see them often.  Not some stupid sappy Bollywood nonsense, search internet for some proper good ones. Search facebook for some mental health self-help pages.  

Use rubber band therapy - more famous for quitting cigarettes / getting over terrible heartbreak uncontrollable thoughts.  Put a rubber band on your wrist - not tight, not loose.  Every time you catch yourself having those defeatist / negative thoughts, pull that rubber band up and PING yourself, snap out of that negative thought.   Actively divert yourself, tell yourself something more positive, as they say ""fake it till you make it"".  Don't let yourself spiral downwards - easier said than done, I know, you just have to keep trying.  

Just gotta push through it.   The chances you were born at all are a mega-gazillion to one, don't give it up!!   Keep visualising a happy you.  Bit by bit, you'll get there!

This Aussie guy, 10 yrs ago caught tuberculosis & the cut out half his lungs.  He's a heavy metal musician / comedian.  He does stuff for mental health, since suffering himself various issues.  Did a kickass 1 and half minute video on mental health self-care - check it out!   

https://youtu.be/p1\_uVfNGxr8  

Overthinque - never give up!!   Go do some zumba!! Just start doing any job, how much ever menial it may seem, or start a small business if you can. Important thing is to keep moving forward. You need to talk to someone close.

 This pandemic has been tough, finding a job is hard, so please join to any menial job you can find for now to break the boredom and depression you have. Once you gain some momentum, you can invest yourself to learn more skills like coding.

Read books. Talk to anyone you can. Use ClubHouse app. Good place to meet and share your thoughts. Be strong. Been there, life feels hopeless which lead to the thought that your life has no meaning and might as well kill your self. It took me a long time to come out of that state of mind. 

To build your confidence, work somewhere, eventually you will start believing in yourself. Don't worry about marriage for the time being , try to financially secure yourself. 

It's a hard road but eventually everything will fall in place. Hey man, same age and same boat as you are in. 

Just wanted to say thank you for sharing. I find comfort in knowing im not alone feeling like this. Likewise i hope you Also find comfort in knowing you arent alone in this. I too have the same problem. I now have alcohol issues too. Life basically sucks for me😣 The marriage point is also what I've seen leads to anxiety. In the US or any western country you wont be judged for staying single, let alone pushed to marry. Also I feel for guys this is worse, while it's aesthetics for women for guys it's also the financial component that judges your worth in the marriage market.

This is a bad year for the economy and so many fresh grads / unemployed people wont get hired bec of State of the economy. I curse those election rallies and religious gatherings every day I read such comments. We are kind of in same boat, but let me tell you life is worth living. There are thousands of reasons to wake up everyday . I will recommend you should try to  get a low tear job , lower then your qualification then try to put life into prospective. 

Nobody around you know what they are doing with their life, no one is expert. 

 I am assuming, if you writing this on reditt then you must be from some city or town just get out of there for a while in rural area and see how people live and how nice they are and how they live life without basic facilities we have in cites.  our life in closed spaces can  consume us from inside.

At last, try to read any thing a book an article doesn't matter. 

Good luck for life my friend"

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/india) if you have any questions or concerns.* He is an Herbal Naxal must be caught immediately trying to distract Indians from main problems caused by the pandemic. Smart move, government Baba’ Ramdev is a reasonably proficient yoga expert. That’s about it. Everything else about him is fake. Here’s the details :
1) In no Hindu Monastic Order, is there any position or role or accredition  as ‘Baba’. The lower most runk in the order is Brahmachari, followed by Chaitanya, the Swami and then couple of more and upto Maha-mandaleshwara. The highest runk is Shankaracharya. There is no Baba. So Baba Ramdev is a self-styled, self-declared, self-claimed role more towards personal branding. It is fraudulent and fake. Can you claim that you are Major or Colonel of the Military order? You cannot. Even if you do, it is fake. Hope that clarifies.

2) Well, even if he is! Which monastic order does he belong to? Genuine Hindu Monastic orders of Hinduism are well known. They are known as Akharas as Juna Akhara, Niranjani akhara etc. Arya Samaj, Bharat Sevasram Sangha, Ramkrishna Mission etc are well known.. There are many others. Which one does Baba Ramdev belong to? No one knows.

3) Patanjali is neither a brand and nor is discovered by Baba Ramdev. Patanjali is a Ayurvedic methodology given by Rishi Patanjali. Ramdev has claimed it as innocent people do not know much about all this. It is generic and cannot be branded. Can you brand Allopathy, Homeopathy? You cannot. That explains.

4) Attire/dress of any sadhu is sacred to him. Genuine sadhus do not change them ever. Baba wore salwar-kameez and ran away until he was caught by Delhi police in India. He was fleeing after political participation.

So take Ramdev only as an Yoga Expert. Not even as Yoga Guru. Yoga Gurus of India are the likes of BKS Iyeger and Sivanandaji. Ramdev must be appreciated for reaching yoga to every kitchen, bedroom and drawing of India. That’s it! Remember how he got lathi in Congress era and had to wear a saree to escape? Though I absolutely detest police brutality, I hate this fraud even more.

Of course, Modi will ban Twitter for it, but those who can use VPNs will still be on Twitters and the gaumutra brigade, who can barely speak without frothing at the mouth, will be safely corralled in their Poo app.

nk958b,"Guys we need to understand this game the BJP PR team is playing. They have been giving the country various narratives to save brand Modi. The different narratives we have now are :- 

- It’s you the people who did not follow covid norms so the entire pandemic. 

- No other government could’ve managed the pandemic better. India would’ve been finished had Modi ji not been the PM

- It is the state governments that have failed since the centre gave them a free hand to do whatever they could to stop the spread. 

- It is due to Nehru and Gandhi that India has a socialist environment due to which Adar Poonawalla left the country and hence Vaccine mismanagement.

- Nobody held your hand or forced you to attend rallies or Kumbh Mela 

And finally another door opened 

- More people died due to wrong medication than anything else. It’s all due to allopathy. The doctors are to blame. 


See with soo many different narratives they want to confuse the people into believing only one of them so that all neutral people grow a slight doubt about this government to be totally responsible for the pandemic and eventually grow that slight doubt into surety that it was anything but Brand Modi that caused such a catastrophe. 

P.S. Sorry if I missed any of the other fake narratives created to divert attention.",The entire Ramdev fiasco is a new narrative added to the existing ones !,Politics," BJP PR team is failing so bad they are basically trying to stop the game now (Twitter). Nobody believes this dhongi and at the end, people will go to doctors to get treated not him and everyone knows it. Even the union health minister has started backtracking because he knows this is not gonna end well. 

Ramdev is trying to be a distraction but at this point, he seems to be acting like a BJP spokesperson since everyone saw his close connections. When he looses the public image battle, so does BJP and they cannot support him officially as GoI because that would absolutely destroy their image in the world's eyes or whatever is left of it.

Appeal to the Centre to import vaccines and distribute to the States: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal",Politics," Serious Q - what’s the center’s plan? 

Also, why has vaccine drive slowed down to a halt even though Covaxin and Covishield supplies to center have remained the same Apr-May? What a way for the central gobermint to dodge responsibility. Tell states to go out on a vaccine hunt because you didn't do your job, and when they fail you blame them. So people literally are captive in this country without options. All options are via central government which is lazing around waiting for more people to die? WTF is wrong with politicians? Do we have to march on the capital to get ourselves heard?

Almost feels like each state will have to go its own way. Why pay taxes to the centre? Why does BJP do ""this India is my motherland country"" bullshittery when they clearly dont believe in it themselves? Check out the replies. People are celebrating. Dumb BJP IT Cell people are celebrating unavailability of vaccines. This is the true scope of their pseudo nationalism and patriotism! 😅 Tell Pfizer and Moderna, states in India are aatma-nirbhar. The comment  section is so toxic there! What is wrong with people they already knew it before hand , we all know that these companies are dealing with central govts all over the world not state govts.

 this all just fucking politics going on , center is not going to spend a single dime on these 2 companies , they don't care , they can't manage shit , they have no planning , expect events this the most fucking insensitive govt in the whole world .

 btw a very friend of mine flew to California in April , walked into the local pharma and got vaccinated, no paperwork, no cost, no documents needed. Indian citizen got vaccinated in states with no 0 documents or hassle , while Indian citizens cannot vaccinated here. I just hope that the virus doesn't mutate more and actually become vaccine resistant. Meanwhile, Maharashtra government has already stepped up for a third wave, so I don't think anybody is going to get vaccinated anytime soon. It's central government's job to provide vaccines to the states so they can vaccinate people. it's not state's job to put global tendors for vaccines. I don't understand why is there no outrage by all the state governments. It's a pandemic like a catastrophic event and center can't run away with this like it has no responsibility in it. They should be held accountable. If we don't vaccinate enough people, it won't stop at the third wave. Couple of questions for my knowledge sakes,

1) One of the tweets asks why didn't he order Covishield and Covaxin? I'm assuming coz they can't take any more orders or is there more to it? Where are other states procuring vaccines from? Is there a centralized places to access this information?

2) One of the other replies claims that Delhi's healthcare budget is 9k crores, and they shouldn't struggle as much as they are, is this accurate?"

>What's happening in Lakshadweep? A thread.

Ever since former Gujarat MoS Home Minister and Modi's close confidant Praful Khoda Patel was appointed as Administrator late last year, he has taken the following repressive measures using the pandemic as cover

1.Changed the SoP in place that had resulted in 0 covid cases in Lakshadweep in all of 2020. Cases have sky rocketed since and 317 cases were reported just yesterday. Total of 22 deaths.

2. Arrest people who had erected anti-CAA/NRC boards earlier.

3. Enact a Goonda Act when Lakshadweep has the lowest crime rate in the country. The people believe this is to target those protesting against union government policies.

4. Remove non-vegetarian items from the school food menu.

5. Promulgate a regulation criminalizing slaughter of cattle and transportation and trade of beef products. Even slaughter of other animals will require prior permission.

6. Introduce a draft law to disqualify panchayat members with more than 2 kids.

7. Dismiss hundreds of contract and casual workers employed by government offices. Terminate mid-day meal workers, physical education teachers etc.

8. Close down 38 Anganwadis.

9. Stop freight transit through Beypore port in Kerala to cut traditional ties with the state.

10. Citing the Coast Guard Act and demolishing the temporary sheds built by fishermen to store their nets and equipments, with permission from the previous administration. This in a place where fishing is the main source of income.

11. Lift restrictions on sale of alcohol.

12. Propose the widening of roads in a manner in which many homes and buildings will have to be demolished. This in a place where traffic is low because the number of vehicles are less.

13. Promote large scale private tourism ventures.

14. All diary farms in Lakshadweep have been ordered closed and Gujarat-based Amul milk products are being forced onto the people. They have called for a boycott. Critical social media posts are being censored and internet blackout looms large.

These decisions have been taken against the wishes of the people primarily to curb the democratic rights of the ~64,000 people who live in the territory, 97% of whom are muslims.

The anti-people, undemocratic hindutva project must be resisted strongly.

Picked this from [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lonelyredcurl/status/1396495602251309056?s=19)...

2) We have AAP - he can't even hold Delhi
3) Fu*k it, ain't going with Communist or any other party.

Unlike these guys who regard any questioning and criticism of the Guru as blasphemous. Harshvardhan insulted Manmohan Singh in a letter when he proposed solutions to combat Covid. 

Harshvardhan wrote a love letter to Ramdev when he insulted allopathic meds and our doctors.

Rest are diseases that will occur as one gets old and is exposed to stress. It's like asking if I keep shooting myself in head, is there a permanent way to stop injuring myself. Why are they comparing allopathy and ayurveda? We can accept that both methods are not perfect. Both have some pros and cons. Listen to Grubstakers episode 28 to get an idea of this clown and his brand. Really eye opening. He has asked some good questions to IMA now it is upto them how they react, after all allopathy medicine is 200 yrs old and having best scientists and equipments to come with the solutions of some grave problems which are also silently destroying humanity."
nk37v9,"Hi. I'm a covid survivor, 33M. Had a CT scan score of 19/25, termed as severe lung infection. Was treated for exactly 31 days out of which first 6 days I was treated at home and last 25 days I was in hospital. I was administered heavy steroid doses from day 1. Apparently my fever was not going down and doctors (we consulted may 3-4 doctors in initial 4-5 days) concluded I'm in cytokine storm. One of them recommended steroids and i got that (still not sure if that was the right call).


Later when I was hospitalized, I was again on steroids. They continued for another 15 days making it 20 days in total. I was also on oxygen continuously for 22 days. It started with around 12-15ltrs and remained as high as 6-8ltrs till day 15th. It is only after that I needed less oxygen and was eventually taken off only during last three days of my hospital stay.


Though I'm not diabetic and my age also works in my favor but I still was reading about black fungus during this time and decided to act proactively.


So due to steroids, my sugar shot to 150+ levels for initial few days. My research told me that sugar and oxygen aid black fungus I decided to act. Firstly, the hospital food, I deliberately asked for tea without sugar, salty biscuits and avoided any sweet dish that was part of my meals. I noticed that my sugar later was within 120 always. 


Secondly, I made it a point to clean my nostrils at least twice a day. I used tissues soaked in sanitizer. And cleaned my nostrils with them. Also took out huge blood clots from them. And noticed that blood clot formation is a regular affair and got it cleaned.


Third thing I did was to ask any junior doctor on round to check around my nostrils and inside my mouth for early black spots. I also did the same using my phone camera.


Fast forward and I'm discharged. Two days later i had pain, redness and swelling in my left eye. They looked like symptoms of black fungus. Thankfully after few consultations and MRI, it turned out to be normal allergy thanks to my weakened immune. But I told doc about my cleaning of nostrils etc and doctors appreciated.


Point is, if you have any loved one in hospital or you yourself are in it, try taking measures I did and may be you'll reduce chances of black fungus drastically.


One more thing I took care was that the water which is used to hydrate Oxygen is always mineral water. And my oxygen masks and nasal pipes are replaced with new ones in 4-5 days time. This was just to ensure general hygiene of these things.


Hope this helps.

Edit: Also blowing air from nostrils (like you do to push mucus in normal cold) also helps to bring forth deeper clots but not recommended if your saturation is below 90 or so. Brings down oxygen by 2-3 points.

Edit: i realise that putting sanitizer in your nose is not best of ideas. But I had little choice. Anyways, all the tips given here are from my own research and personal experience. If you can get a doctor's advice ""on time"" for any of these follow that.",Some tips to avoid Mucormycosis (Black Fungus),Unverified," This is a personal unverified account. While respecting the OP’s account here, please do not take the information mentioned in the post or comments as a gospel and consult your doctor before making any changes to your prescription. Tread carefully. > Secondly, I made it a point to clean my nostrils at least twice a day. I used tissues soaked in sanitizer. And cleaned my nostrils with them

This doesn’t seem right. You are not supposed to put sanitizer into your nose. Did a doctor ok this? This post is complete BS at so many levels. Will explain you in short,

* Mucor is an opportunistic infection. It won't affect healthy people. The risk of getting it is in people with diabetes, chronic steroid use, immunocompromised people, trauma/burns, and malnutrition. You are not even in the risk group for getting mucormycosis. 
* Mucorales (agents of mucormycosis) are ubiquitous fungi. There is no way to avoid exposure, and the primary mode of acquisition is by inhalation of spores from the environment. Good hospital hygiene and distilled/sterile water for humidification of oxygen will help here, not the nasal hygiene by putting sanitizer, as you are recommending. Putting alcohol-based sanitizer will damage nasal mucosa and will further increase the risk of secondary infection. 
* I will also recommend against blowing the nose. Nasal mucosa becomes dry sometimes if you are on oxygen therapy. You may end up injuring major blood vessels in your nose, causing epistaxis while blowing it. 
* I don't know why that doc gave you steroids from day one. It is not recommended for the first seven days of illness (cytokine storm comes after seven days). Giving steroids in the initial days of illness enhances viral multiplication and worsens the situation. 

ref: I am an Intensivist. Allergies are to due an exaggerated immune response and certainly not 'caused by' a weak immunity. Also, direct application of sanitiser (presumably hand sanitiser - through soaked tissues as you describe) is almost certain to damage the sensitive olfactory and respiratory epithelium. Its called hand sanitiser for a reason! Wonder how the doctors appreciated this, unless you never bothered to tell them about your ritual. 
>	One more thing I took care was that the water which is used to hydrate Oxygen is always mineral water.

What does this even mean?!! You're a fighter!

One question, wasn't your brain foggy with all the drugs? I ask because, my family member same age as you, didn't comprehend simple instructions or respond to simple questions. It was so frustrating for me as a care giver. Very important about the mineral water for the oxygen. So did you have a friend or relative do this for you? Wondering how a person who is to themselves in the hospital can manage this. (Seems like some people are in the hospital and nobody can visit them.) Not really sure how much step #2 helped. Mucor is spread by spores. You would've breathed those in. Cleaning your nostrils did nothing. The diet one is good advice.. Heavy steroid doses from day 1? What's happening, is there some new guidelines that I'm not aware of. Am i missing something or they are trying to kill people. थthanks for detailed account.

Can you also share, what was the level of o2 when you were admitted?

Every good college conducts entrance exams or interviews here. Colleges who don't should do it too. the truth is that the government doesn't really care about the students, or anyone that doesn't make them profit. it's futile to argue. we are at the mercy of whatever the fuck decision these dumbtwats make. we're all on the same drowning boat in this hellish cycle of our ""education system"" I am not sure why the govt is holding exams. Right now any mass gatherings are dangerous. 

We've stopped COVID because of lockdowns, not vaccines. 

Promoting students is important, and having exams is important sure, but compared to setting off another COVID wave? Can someone objectively explain the other side of the coin?

Its an issue faced by other nations as well, so it is not a problem with a simple solution. Students are treated like cattle in our nation , cattle should not have opinion  right?🥴🥴. True. I think we should contact news channels and let them know what the stakeholders i.e. the student body thinks in this matter and what's best for them. we are all literally so mentally pressurised right now.  
8 minutes ago sad icse crying noises But that would make us a decent democracy I really don't want to sit for exams before 2 jabs.
Even with apt preparation, it's still not fair. 
Wish we could boycott them as a community. We catered to every one of their commands for the past 14 years just so they could kill us now...seems fair. Bhai, students arent listened to by own parents, you think govt cares? Students are only important when their fee is due"

If your number is there you can't do anything about it now. It's already leaked.

But if you go and check your number, there is a possibility that they may be building a list of active users.. The moment you input your number, they could mark it as active and use it for further spamming or whatever.

I'm not saying they're doing this, but it's possible. What measures can we take now ? They literally have our exact GPS coordinates. I mean what the fuck man. The company needs to pay for this wtf Fuck can you imagine what position this puts all those girls in who get stalked or harassed on their phones - now their harassers have their exact GPS coordinates thanks to dominos.

The Centre has asked us to place global tenders but it is also talking to these companies separately. When they asked us to buy from manufacturers in India, we placed orders but the supply is being regulated by the Centre. The Centre puts curbs on how much we can get from private companies. The international manufacturers are saying they are talking to the Centre only. I ask the Centre to show some seriousness since this is a very serious disease,” Sisodia said.

Firstly, center should be procuring for the whole nation itself. It can greatly amplify the negotiating power. Forcing states to compete for limited supplies turns the tender into an auction. This comes in the favor of those private companies rather than the masses. 

And now they won’t even allow states to procure them. From what I understand the drug companies want indemnification from any claims relating to the vaccine doses. Such indemnifications are most effective when it is given by the sovereign government of a country. Central government has been dragging their feet on indemnification (though UK and US gave such indemnities). Drug companies wouldn't want to deal with state level governments who can't provide such indemnification. I am sure Modi knew that Pfizer/Moderna don't sell to states when he said ""Not my problem, you get your own vaccines"".

We lost valuable time due to this silly games. Even a heavily federal government like the US centrally procured the vaccines and distributed them to the states. Only in India, the states are left to fend for themselves in a global market. I believe when it comes to vaccines there should be no free market or liberalisation. The procurement and distribution should be completed centralised. This way the centre holds the bargaining chip when dealing with international manufacturers and in turn people can hold the government accountable. Similar news coming from other states as well. As usual, central cowernment employee a smokescreen tactic to shift blame/responsibility on states rather than doing high volume procurement for the WHOLE nation using a massive negotiation power for 100 Cr people.

A little background- I come from a conservative Marwari Jain Family. I always knew I will have to get married in my 20's but not this early. I am driven and independence is everything to me. Growing up, we never had enough money. I always had food and clothing but we didn't have more. I studied, made sure I got a good job and am doing as well as a person can 2 years into their job. I love working.

Now that I am nearing 23, they are going crazy. They want me to quit my job, marry rich, sit at home, and work ""if your in-laws allow"". My anxiety is shooting through the roof because this is the exact opposite of what I want. I want to work and have a life that I build for myself. The pressure is unbelievable.

What do I do? I want to delay this as much as possible. Mine is a joint family and I have no one I can talk to. My friends have been there for me but they can't help the situation.

I can't leave, I don't want to stay here. Are there any resources I can use, anyone I can reach out to for help?

Please share anything that might be useful.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for all the support and the awards. I won't be able to respond to all comments but I am reading all of them, I promise. For now, I have agreed to meet the guys just to cool things off. I will tell them what my aspirations are & most guys will bolt after that. As for the rest, guess I'll just tell them I don't want to marry so quick. Thank you again- Y'all are super cool. Sending love and hugs! :)",My(22f) family is hell-bent on getting me married soon. I don't want to get married anytime soon. What do I do?,AskIndia," Given the current situation, if you're working from home then you have no option but to stand up for yourself (maybe even at the expense of your peace of mind.)

A friend of mine is facing the same problem. Whenever her parents make her meet a guy (forcefully) she tells him outright that she doesn't want to marry and won't be able to adjust to his household or become a good wife. This has caused her parents to yell at her several times. However, she has continued to be respectful in making her opinion known to her family (I wouldn't have had the patience to do that, tbh.)

You have to be able to say ""I"" before you can say ""I want this"". You've mentioned in your post that you can't leave, so that means you have no means to keep avoiding this situation. You'll have to face it head-on.

I can understand how difficult and disappointing it is when your own family does not understand your wishes, but this decision is going to influence your entire life. Elders don't always know what's best (contrary to what we've been taught since childhood.) Please stay strong and choose your own path. Easiest solution to be independent is find a job a bit far from your hometown or in certain big cities and move there by own. It is never easy to educate conservative families specially marwari jain for whom a good groom is basically who sits at shop and you sit at home with ghunghat. 
Being said that finding good job in current situations is not too easy. Buy some time, keep rejecting on whatever basis till you can move out on your own. You'll have to distance yourself from your family, both physically and mentally. Move out and stay elsewhere - PG / rented / with friends. Early marriage is to get rid of daughters to reduce family's expenditure. If your family opposes moving out, you can accuse them of this and say you're helping them reduce expenditure. To shut them up. ask on r/twoxindia . It's sub specifically for women. Maybe they can be of more help You have to stand up for yourself, this is the last resort. Just tell them that you are not going to marry someone so early. If they agree then good, orelse make some arrangement to move out. I was in your situation last year. They wanted me to get married, I told them no but they didn't listen. They even  blackmailed me, they really put me in a tough spot. I explained to them why I didn't want to get married, gave them every logical reason I could but of no use. So I did the only thing I could at that time, One fine morning without telling anyone I just left from the house. Of course I sent them a text after I left the house that I was leaving and told them why I was leaving. I didn't even have a job. I didn't even knew what I was gonna do but I couldn't live in that house anymore. In your case since you say you have a job I suggest you move out of house. You are a major and according to Article 21 of constitution you have the right to get married to the person you like. Your parents can't force you to get married without your consent, you can even file a police complaint or at least threaten your parents that you will file police complaint(If you think that helps). Resort to this option in worst case scenario. All the best. Hope everything works out well for you. Hmm, if you're financially independent then just live on your own.

Make sure you have friends close by. 

Don't divulge your family issues to work ppl/boss( especially men). 

Stand up to your family, they have nothing on you. 

DO NOT COMPROMISE AT ALL. and good luck :)

Edit : Bruh I'm older than you and I don't think I'm emotionally mature enough to handle marriage. And even if I were, are you kidding me? I'm not gonna watse my prime years for  someone else.

At the end of the day, nothing else matters but you. If your family can't support you rn, then you don't need them. Even birds fly out their nests dude, it's only humans and indian parents in particular who bully their children into making dumbass life decisions. If you have a job and savings, find a PG and go no-contact with your family. This might sound harsh but that's your only resort. Your only option is to leave. 

Do you have any friends or family elsewhere that are ready to take you in? 

I have a school friend who also comes from a very conservative family, she's currently pursuing her masters in sociology and wants to a PhD but she's afraid that her family might marry her off after her masters are over. Anyhow, I have told her that if she's ever forced to get married, she can come live with me or my mom, or any of my other girlfriends. 

Anyhow, depends on where you are and if you're comfortable, I have a great a network of friends who are willing to help a fellow sister. If you just want to vent or anything, feel free to PM me. >I can't leave, I don't want to stay here.

If you don't want to get married this early in life, that too on their terms, rebel. Why do you mean by you can't leave? 

Your family is conservative and I am sure no amount of logical reasoning will change their stance on what you should do with your life.

If you are financially independent, leave. If leaving is not an option because of the pandemic, rebel. Act out, take a stand for yourself and refuse to get married, however much drama it requires to get the point across. 

They will call you selfish, will try to emotionally blackmail and manipulate you and might get aggressive and violent too. So, you do the same. Call them selfish, threaten to commit suicide and do whatever it takes to make them take a step back.

Edit - I know this seems extreme but sometimes it's the only way to counter a conservative family. It's a tried and tested solution. 

You get away from the problem now and establish boundaries or keep submitting to your family's countless toxic expectations in the future. You don't need to be a ""good daughter"", you only need to be a human who has worth. Talk to your parents and take a stand. I know it's difficult. But do it, don't give up. Wow... Ur in a really tough position... One wrong step and BAM ur married. 

Few suggestion from my end -

1. If you are working from home then you can try to move near your work location and rent a place (if possible as it could be difficult if ur in same city of ur work and this situation)

2. How long do u have once have to start looking for guys fir marriage. I mean you can delay your actual marriage by taking time to know different guys(one of my friend is doing this). Just don't commit anything to him. 

3. You can directly ask ur parents for 2 years or 1 year or just until this pandemic situation is over. This will buy you some time to think and find better options. 

Hope this could help. DM if u wanna talk to someone. 

PS. These are just my suggestion, don't want to hurt anyone's emotions here."

But it's not by Cloudflare DNS - that's returning the correct IP. 

It's actually being blocked by ACT itself. Most probably it's checking the domain name during HTTPS handshake and blocking based on that.

Simplest bypass would be to download Tor Browser. Or if you have your own VPS somewhere outside India and are familiar with SSH, you can setup your own SOCKS proxy to bypass it. Well Protonvpn has generous free plan. It's secure, open source, no logs and audited. You can check it out. Speed might be slower because most of the free servers are highly loaded, but still worth to check.

While going through the list of documents online (Link below), we found a document which requires either one party to present proof of stay in Delhi for the last 30 days and either ration card or SHO report are mentioned as options.

I don't have a ration card and I want to avoid haggling with Delhi police for any work (they usually ask for bribes for any work and are too slow).

For this proof of stay, can i submit my Aadhar Card, Passport copy or any other document?

What document did you submit? Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.

Thank you very much

You can clearly see how samsung seal was taken off and placed back. It was placed bit off hence the leftover glue caught dust particles. Have you contacted them? Have they accepted the return? Or asked for the video? I think it will benefit everyone if you tell us the aftermath if possible please I haven't ordered anything from Flipkart for almost 4 years. They're extremely notorious for sending fake/faulty items. Even their gadget exchange program is really shitty

I think you should always order expensive stuff from Amazon because it comes in a tamper proof packaging, and you also get an OTP without which delivery boy can't mark the order as delivered. Flipkart ne kiya hai, soch samaj ke kiya hoga I am a seller on Flipkart, I have received bricks and stones, counterfeit products or wrong products when customers return the products I sell. 

Most of the time they refuse to give claims and hold us responsible but the logistics are at wrong here. My experience with Flipkart has always been unsatisfactory. Its not like I got a completely different item, but either its the bad packaging, late delivery or unavailability of product.  

So I have stopped ordering from Flipkart altogether and have been only ordering from Amazon(far better experience atleast till now) since last few years or order directly from Company website. I always make a video of whole unpacking process Good luck getting a refund/replacement from Flipkart! Their customer service is the worst. That’s why I only use Amazon, no hassles and no questions asked returns. Maybe it’s the galaxy from Men in Black? At least , you got a watch !"

nju2fs,"I am watching(again) new videos of the situation outside Indian hospitals. Few years ago my Father died of ILD(Interstitial Lung Disease). The symptoms are similar to that of COVID-19, i.e. the lungs fail and the patient starts suffocating due to lack of oxygen. At that time there was no pandemic. Even then I was running pillar to post for my father's treatment. I use to curse every day why the country does not have a national health service. Does it make sense to talk about becoming ""super power"" when the citizens of the country cannot even have a dignified death?!? It is high time that India learns from this collapse of its ""healthcare system""(if at all it has one!). We desperately need a healthcare system on the lines of the UK NHS. Lives matter more than money! No one has to face the black marketeers when their loved ones are dying! We should not repeat this system collapse again! That is the demand everyone of us should make living aside politics. Young housewives who have never worked, when the food earner of the house is lost to the virus, where are they going to go! I have seen heart breaking images of young women crying, who have no where to go. Think about that! A country which talks about dignity/""ijjat"" of women has failed to look after them! We should, for heaven's sake, start thinking of providing at least the basic necessacities to the country. Is this the sign of the ""super power"" where we become a laughing stock of the world because we are incapable of even providing the basics?

Certain things, such as healthcare and education, should not be left to private sector alone! A robust public sector in these areas make a difference to the growth of the country. If citizens are not healthy and well educated then that country is doomed whatever it may try to do somewhere else!

And for heaven's sake stop this left-vs-right nonsense and start thinking of who is the one that can provide the basic necessacities to the citizens, irrespective of who that person is. We are too eager to get swayed by this divide-and-rule tactics so much so that we have switched off our brains when it comes to even thinking of what is beneficial to us.

I dream of a day when the country during election period discusses issues such as healthcare, education, farming, climate change, research, infrastructure etc instead of caste, religion, region and language! It is sad to see during election period TV channels discussing caste, religion, region and language statistics with respect to seat sharing rather than the development agends(and its viabilities) of political parties.",I am saying this again so that the message spreads!,Non-Political," We get what we vote for. 

Population as a whole will not care if more hospitals built. But yeah roads and freebies are excellent. Add in reservations and add in free rides and they love you.

And then there is the North Indian belt , in particular that loves the religious card. Play that and they love you even more.

No one really cares on education health or heck economic growth. Could you just tldr [removed]"

### Tl;dr

Under the Intermediaries and Digital Media Rules, significant social media intermediaries had a host of obligations to comply with, and the deadline to complete such compliance was 3 months from the date of notification of the Rules. That’s 25th May, 2021. The compliances that significant social media intermediaries are onerous and may stifle innovation in the Indian digital space. Social media is broken and the responsibility for this is shared by silicon valley companies that enable it. But, these rules are problematic, for in many places, rather than fixing it, it actually makes it worse.

### Background

On February 25, 2021, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) issued the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (the Intermediaries Rules). We have [**written before** ](https://internetfreedom.in/intermediaries-rules-2021/)about how the Intermediaries Rules are unconstitutional, undemocratic and negatively change the way we use the internet in India. As time has passed since their notification, the Intermediaries Rules have also been contentious.

There has been high controversy on them with at least six writ petitions ([**click to view our tracker)**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kmq-AlRO1XpPaThvesl5xQq2nVkZv6UdmaKFAJ8AMTk/edit?usp=sharing) have been filed before three different High Courts of India, challenging these Rules. IFF has provided legal assistance to LiveLaw Media Private Limited in its challenge before the High Court of Kerala. This also includes arguments and reliefs from the perspective of users of social media. The Hon’ble Single Judge of the Kerala High Court was pleased to provide protection to LiveLaw Media against coercive action from MIB and MeitY in respect of the Intermediaries Rules.

### What happens tomorrow?

Under Rule 4 of the Intermediaries Rules, significant social media intermediaries were [**given three months from February 25, 2021**](https://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2021/225497.pdf) to comply with the special provisions that apply to them. As the deadline for compliance with the Intermediaries Rules approaches, we take a look at what compliance will mean for significant social media intermediaries, and how such compliance can impact you! How it will stifle producer and user innovation and creativity in startups and platforms that may fall within the definition of significant social media intermediaries.

This is not only applicable to significant social media intermediaries, but also indian companies which are gaining scale in India and globally. It is necessary, then, to look at the actual provisions of the Intermediaries Rules to understand what a “significant social media intermediary” is, and what additional compliances are expected of them.

### ELI5 “social media intermediary”

Most of the time we (most people) spend online is on a social media platform. It provides them a place to discover interests, chat about politics and news, organise on issues and even emergency and disaster relief. As they are giving you a platform, they are not the authors and editors, they are called intermediaries. These social media companies are broadly termed as, “social media intermediaries”. Now, coming to the more technical explanation (excuse a bit of repetition, but this is important). Intermediaries which primarily or solely enable online interaction between multiple users and allow them to create and share information have been defined as ‘social media intermediaries’ under Rule 2(w) of the Intermediaries Rules.

Among them, the intermediaries that have more than 50 lakh (5 million) registered users have been designated as ‘significant social media intermediaries’, according to Rule 2(v) of the Intermediaries Rules and Notification S.O. 942(E) dated February 25, 2021 issued by MeitY. This sub-class, “significant social media intermediaries” come with additional compliances. But, 50 lakh is a small number when it comes to account sign-ups if a technology service is popular. Numbers add up fast! So, many platforms beyond Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp and Youtube will be impacted by them.

### So what are these compliances?

https://preview.redd.it/x8ehwpw151171.png?width=4761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a525950705a41927b6060592bd788363a91222e0

 

We have written about the issues with the Intermediaries Rules before: in our [**Deep Dive into the Rules**](https://internetfreedom.in/intermediaries-rules-2021/), we summarise some of the main compliance requirements of significant social media intermediaries below.

* Reduced timelines for takedowns and assistance to government agencies. Previously, in the Information Technology (Intermediaries guidelines) Rules, 2011  the Grievance Officer was responsible for receiving complaints from users concerning the Rules and redressing them within a month. Now, the Grievance Officer is responsible for acknowledging complaints within 24 hours and resolving them within a reduced timeline of 15 days. The Grievance Officer has also been made responsible for the receipt and acknowledgement of any order, notice or direction. Further, under the 2011 Rules, intermediaries had to “act within thirty-six hours and where applicable, work with the user or owner of such information” to take it down. Under the new Intermediaries Rules, intermediaries must \*complete\* the takedown process under Section 79(3) of the IT Act, within 36 hours. Lastly, the 2011 Rules did not specify a timeline within which intermediaries were required to provide information or assistance to law enforcement agencies. The Intermediary Rules have provided intermediaries with a 72-hour limit for providing such information or assistance.
* Further, the 2011 Rules did not specify any consequences upon the intermediaries for failing to comply with the provisions of the Rules; the consequence was relatively direct -- they lost immunity! The Intermediaries Rules, 2021 however, expressly state a loss of immunity and indicate a level of severity of consequences, including potential criminal prosecution under provisions of the IT Act and the Indian Penal Code. This is a major barrier for potential entrants into the sector, who may either not have the necessary resources to acquire the necessary legal capabilities to deal with such obligations or may be scared away by the threat of criminal prosecution. It will undermine social sharing and conversation functions in any user, community centric technical environment.

### Additional compliances for “significant social media intermediaries”

On top of these, several additional compliances have been imposed on significant social media intermediaries under Rule 4 of the Intermediaries Rules for which the deadline is May 25. Rule 4(1) of the Intermediaries Rules states that significant social media intermediaries must publish monthly compliance reports of action taken in respect of grievances received by the grievance officer (Rule 4(1)(d)), and also appoint at least three distinct officers:

1. A chief compliance officer, who will be responsible for ensuring compliance with the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Intermediaries Rules;
2. A nodal contact person for 24x7 coordination with law enforcement agencies; and
3. A resident grievance officer, who must reside in India and receive complaints, acknowledge them within 24 hours and respond within 15 days.

All three officers appointed by the significant social media intermediaries, as above, are now legally required to reside in India. Significant social media Intermediaries are also required to have a physical contact address in India \[Rule 4(5)\]. Officer’s details and the physical contact address must be prominently published on its website or mobile-based Internet application. It is important to note that the Home Ministry has fortnightly meetings with all social media entities in India. This will no doubt erect a significant entry barrier to the sector, as new entrants will now have to invest a major chunk of their resources towards developing such a compliance mechanism. While behemoths like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram will easily be able to do it, smaller Indian startups will face greater financial pressure in implementation. This will also reinforce higher entry barriers when startups start to scale to the 50 lakh limit. It simply means reduced competition and hence lower levels of innovation and value for users.

Additionally, significant social media intermediaries must allow users to voluntarily verify their identity (Rule 4(7)). This could lead to a scenario where the voluntary becomes mandatory, as is the case with many other technologies which were introduced as “voluntary” but eventually made mandatory in an indirect manner. For instance, the Data Protection Bill also contains a similar proposal to link Government IDs with our social media accounts! Again, as Indian consumers begin to [**value privacy and data security further**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/indians-care-deeply-about-privacy-of-personal-data-shows-new-study-117121500346_1.html/), even if established platforms are able to navigate such obligations, new players looking to emerge in the field would be significantly hampered by such constraints.

### What really concerns us is your free expression and privacy!

Some of the more troubling aspects of the Intermediaries Rules coming into force on May 25 are Rules 4(2) and 4(4). Under Rule 4(2), significant social media intermediaries that are primarily in the nature of messaging services must enable the traceability of the originator of messages. This is severely detrimental to the [**fundamental rights of speech and privacy**](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-files-independent-expert-submission-before-madras-hc/) of all citizens, since it will essentially undermine end-to-end encryption and likely cause a chilling effect on speech in private conversations.

While the Intermediaries Rules clarify that in doing so, the significant social media intermediary shall not be required to disclose the contents of any electronic message, any other information related to the first originator, or any information related to its other users, the Information Technology Decryption Rules contain powers to make demands for the message content. Used together, the government will have the power to break any type of end-to-end encryption to gain knowledge of who sent what message and also get to know its contents. As we have mentioned previously, more and more Indians are valuing their privacy: [**84% Indian consumers willing to pay more to do business with organisations committed to protecting data privacy**](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/84-indian-consumers-willing-to-pay-more-to-do-business-with-organisations-committed-to-protecting-data-privacy-report/article34066225.ece). Thus, for enterprises and start-ups who have based their business on providing secure platforms for exchanging information, such an obligation would be a death blow, devaluing the enormous amounts of money, time, and research that would have gone into developing rigorous cyber-security standards.

Under Rule 4(4) of the Intermediaries Rules, significant social media intermediaries must enable ‘automated tools’, or basically AI technology, to identify and take down child sexual abuse material, or content depicting rape, or any information which is exactly identical in content to information that has previously been removed. This is already an [**example of function creep**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/cbi-surveillance-photodna-microsoft-facebook-youtube-twitter-5516347/), where extreme technological measures contemplated for a limited and very serious use are slowly and imperceptibly utilized for other less serious uses, and it will lead to further function creep.

Big tech like [**Facebook**](https://internetfreedom.in/facebook-human-rights-policy/), [**Twitter**](https://internetfreedom.in/joint-letter-to-twitter-about-removal-of-prashant-bhushan-tweets/), [**Instagram**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/t/statement-by-article-19-instagram-s-censorship-of-covid-19-posts-jeopardises-free-speech/1944), [**Whatsapp**](https://internetfreedom.in/explainer-whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes-2021/), and [**Google**](https://internetfreedom.in/part-2-of-working-paper-explainer-series-unpacking-the-positives-and-risks-of-apple-and-googles-contact-tracing-foray/) often make terrible policies and decisions that are often harming millions of Indians. All of us at IFF, are consistently advocating with our public authorities for user rights centric regulations that help address them. It is our clear belief that the Intermediaries Rules do not fix these outstanding issues, suffer from core defects of procedural and substantive legality and end up harming your rights as well as the innovation which makes the internet so special and exciting. Today, more than ever we need to follow a path that is led by experts and the values of the Indian constitution.

This current media is also responsible for this current situation. When the question should have been about economy and jobs the question was “Aap Aam Kaise khate hai”. Dead bodies booked for defaming PM, HM Yup calling out mass murderers ruling us is a crime, while a charlatan selling snake oil and shitting on real medicine causing deaths and suffering is A-OK.

With a top ENT surgeon in Uttar Pradesh Dr Brij Pal Tyagi saying that he is treating a patient who has contracted Yellow Fungus, the infection, mostly found in reptiles, was not detected with a CT scan in the 45-year-old patient but after performing endoscopy.

In case of black fungus or white fungus, the symptoms are facial swelling, blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties, coughing blood and severe headache. However, the doctors have reportedly said that the yellow fungus starts infecting the patient internally.    
  
**WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS**   
The patient suffering from yellow fungus complains of extreme tiredness, low or no appetite at all which leads to weight loss. Subsequently, the weight of the patient starts decreasing rapidly and it becomes quite fatal. Reportedly, it later results into internal bleeding and multiple organs failure.   
  
**WHAT CAUSES** [YELLOW FUNGUS INFECTION](https://www.editorji.com/story/is-yellow-fungus-more-dangerous-causes-symptoms-and-treatment-1621887632081)   
Excess use of steroids or anti-fungal medicines are also a possible reason behind sudden surge in such infections in Covid-19 patients, even if recovered. It is believed that poor hygiene standards or consumption of unhygienic food causes yellow fungus infection.   
  
**WHAT IS ITS TREATMENT**  
Anti-fungal drug Amphotericin-B is being considered as a primary treatment of yellow fungus. The same injection is being used currently to treat black or white fungus cases in the country.

Scientists and doctors spend years in developing a vaccine or a medicine and these babas throw fire in water and claim that they made medicine!",What went wrong? Why Indians keep on falling for pseudoscience?,AskIndia," I tend to recall that quote by Carl Sagan

'I worry that, especially as the Millennium edges nearer, pseudoscience and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive. Where have we heard it before? Whenever our ethnic or national prejudices are aroused, in times of scarcity, during challenges to national self-esteem or nerve, when we agonize about our diminished cosmic place and purpose, or when fanaticism is bubbling up around us - then, habits of thought familiar from ages past reach for the controls.

The candle flame gutters. Its little pool of light trembles. Darkness gathers. The demons begin to stir.' Its how they are grown up, they listen and see their parents following babas and parents teach them such. For the same reason people put money in chit funds, MLM, and obvious ponzi schemes. 

Little to no critical thinking ability. If our health minister can fall and endorse such pseudoscience then what do you expect from normal public? The raise of this pseudoscience has increased in past 7yrs due to Godiji,  these ayushoes never had this much guts earlier but Godiji came this cow urine propaganda increased most of people started diverting towards them. Admist all this we also have stupid Ramdev who is a piece of sh*t with his sh*tty brand false claims.  In rural villages especially there are so many patanjali shops these days, they are playing with people's innocence and believes. son of a Bhakt is a Bhakt unless he has the will to free from it. I totally agree with u/cipher_unsolved, it is the way they are brought up from childhood. We are highly gullible and we fall for everything. Seeing their parents follow superstitions, they will undoubtedly follow the same. If they try to question the logic behind these activities, they are bashed and are never told the reason behind it. Since we are good at blindly following people and putting them on a pedestal, we never criticize them and they go scot-free We lacked discipline and reason...looks like we will never achieve them May be because there is a taxpayer funded institution called Ayush ministry..I have no problem with Sidha,  ayurveda but they have their limits in the amount of change it can bring about.

You gotta try out things while you are in 11th. Study a programming language, read some books about economics, have all PCMB subjects not just too keep your medical option open. 

Try video editing courses on your own. No matter what you do its definitely desirable skill cause video media gonna keep growing over audio and text media. 

After 12th:

If you love programming, choice is simple. Do CS degree. 

If you liked bio more than maths and logic of programming, go be Doctor.

Im not sure for MBA, if engg is best route (remember reading most IIM guys are engg graduates, then commerce guys and then few doctors) . If it is get enng degree something that interest you and then follow MBA.

Not sure how to choose engg stream, as many guys just go by cut off for particular college than particular stream in different colleges.

This all considering, you have smooth sailing through in beaten path. 

That being said there is always spot at top in any career. 

If you get degree in mass communication and shit, (i don't know what it takes to be joining jpurno really) become journalists in tv, print or online news source. 

You could have do video editing courses coupled with mass communication degree you could do YouTube video which wasn't a career when i was in college. 

Very few people decide I wanna do xyz and end up there using predetermined path. 

Stay open for different opportunities. Choosing some job not gonna be career decider writen in stone type thing.

I have seen linguist being in demand for NLP applications. Dunno those guys actually dreamed of working on it during their degrees.

Good luck for whatever you end up choosing. Airplane pilot Pilot, Security researcher, Logistics, Operations and finally doing own business. Most careers pay well if you can achieve success in it. Some pay even if you are average.      
But looking from the lens of job satisfaction(most important parameter), your income is nowhere the right determinant for it.      
So try to find your interests first and then see how you can achieve excellence in that field, rather than doing it the other way of identifying the high-paying fields and then pushing yourself towards them. Bro just sell pani puri politics"

## tl;dr

Through RTI requests, we were made aware of the ongoing use of facial recognition technology on minors in Government schools in the NCT of Delhi. Mindful of the possible violations of the right to privacy of minors under Article 21 of the Constitution as well as the right to free and compulsory education under Article 21A and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, we wrote to the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) urging them to step in to protect child rights in Delhi.

## What happened?

On December 17, 2020, we filed a [Right to Information (RTI) request](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19LI7_EGk2Bmyn2u3Ta6d0zk-HEa4TLuO/view?usp=sharing) with the Education Department of the Government of NCT of Delhi. Our queries in the request related to the use of facial recognition technology in conjunction with the CCTV cameras installed by the Delhi Government in all government schools in the national capital. Our request stemmed from the [Delhi Government’s decision to install CCTV cameras in more than 1,000 schools](https://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2019/jul/07/delhi-becomes-first-city-to-have-cctvs-at-government-schools-2000402.html) which operate under them. Worried about possible privacy violations as well as use of harmful facial recognition technology in conjunction with the CCTV cameras installed in schools, we asked the Education Department to provide us with information about:

1. the total number of CCTVs installed in government schools;
2. whether facial recognition technology is being used in conjunction with the CCTV cameras and if yes, its purpose and legality;
3. individuals/organisations who may have access to the CCTV feeds;
4. whether there is any Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) or regulation in place to ensure that CCTVs are not misused and that the feed is not accessed illegally;
5. the duration for which the CCTV feed is stored or retained; and
6. the purpose of the installation.

Over the course of the next month, we received more than 100 replies from various schools under the Delhi Government as the Education Department simply transferred our request to the schools and did not answer any of our queries themselves. Multiple schools, in their responses, [confirmed](https://twitter.com/internetfreedom/status/1351497228691464194) our suspicion that facial recognition technology was indeed being used in conjunction with CCTV cameras in their premises. We also received many replies refusing to provide information by saying that the query relates to the Education Department, thereby indicating that facial recognition may still be in use at those schools even though they have not responded in the affirmative.

The decision to employ facial recognition technology in government schools, and operate such technology in respect of minors, violates their constitutional right to privacy as well as adversely impacts the right to education, and the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Similar use in the United States has been criticised by civil society organisations like the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/02/schools-are-pushing-boundaries-surveillance-technologies) and [New York Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/nyclu-statement-new-high-tech-school-security-projects-approved-through-smart-schools) (the New York affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union) which eventually led the State of New York to introduce a [moratorium](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2020/12/22/new-york-issues-first-in-nation-moratorium-on-facial-recognition-in-schools/?sh=6785d54484ba) on the use of facial recognition in schools.

## How does this impact children in Delhi schools?

In K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1, the Supreme Court had the occasion to consider the unique nature of the right to privacy of minors. As minors lack legal capacity to give consent, violations of the right to privacy must be minimized bearing in mind the need to ensure the welfare of the child. The Court further considered the non-derogable nature of the right to education under Article 21A and the RTE Act. These factors must be taken into account in examining the legality of measures affecting the right to privacy of minor children.

As per the Hon’ble Supreme Court's decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1), any justifiable intrusion by the State into people’s right to privacy protected under Article 21 of the Constitution must conform to certain thresholds. These thresholds are:

### 1. Legality

The intrusion must take place under a defined regime of law. There must be an anchoring legislation, with a clear set of provisions. In the absence of such a framework and safeguards, the first requirement for lawful restriction on the right to privacy is not met. As can be seen from the responses, there seems to be no clear Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in place for regulating how facial recognition technology is to be used by these schools. Further, the responses also fail to engage with our query relating to the legality of this use. Specific laws with regard to facial recognition do not currently exist in India. Deployment of facial recognition [without adequate legal safeguards](https://panoptic.in/case-study/problems-with-facial-recognition-technology-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum) is deeply troubling.

### 2. Necessity

The infringement of people’s privacy must be necessary in a democratic society to fulfill a legitimate state aim. In some of the responses above, the schools have stated that use of facial recognition technology in their premises is necessary for security and surveillance purposes. This characterisation is based on a faulty assumption that facial recognition technology is accurate and would provide speedy and correct results. However, ongoing research in the field has shown that facial recognition technology which is completely accurate has not been developed yet. Use of such inaccurate technology will thus result in misidentification.

### 3. Proportionality

The Government must show among other things that the measure being undertaken has a rational nexus with the objective. Facial recognition contemplates collecting sensitive personal information, intimate information of all individuals in the absence of any reasonable suspicion. This could cast a presumption of criminality on a broad set of people. In the Supreme Court’s decision in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1 or the Aadhaar judgment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that:

“\[u\]nder the garb of prevention of money laundering or black money, there cannot be such a sweeping provision which targets every resident of the country as a suspicious person.”

While this statement was made in the context of rejecting the mandatory linkage of Aadhaar with bank accounts to counter money laundering, it clearly shows that the imposition of such a restriction in every Government school classroom, without any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the children, would constitute a disproportionate response. Similarly, collecting sensitive personal information of all children who come under the gaze of a camera enabled with facial recognition technology creates a presumption of criminality which is disproportionate to the objective it aims to achieve.

### 4. Procedural safeguards

Where there is an appropriate independent institutional mechanism, with in-built procedural safeguards aligned with standards of procedure established by law which are just, fair and reasonable to prevent abuse. At present, there is no independent institutional mechanism which would put in place procedural safeguards which will regulate the proposed projects. In the absence of any checks and balances, function creep becomes an immediate problem wherein the issue of facial recognition being used for functions more than its stated purpose becomes a reality. While a flawed Personal Data Protection Bill has been introduced in the Parliament, there is uncertainty about when it will be enacted and implemented and how effective it will be in protecting the personal data of individuals. Under the current version of the Bill, [wide exceptions](https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-5-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019/) have been provided to the Government for surveillance related activities. A [strong data protection legislation](https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-the-data-bill-series-part-1/) is needed to hold these FRT systems accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties. Here, it is also essential to recognise that the data in the present situation relates to minors, who should ideally be given a higher level of protection.

Use of invasive technologies such as facial recognition in schools on children results in disproportionate penalties being imposed on children for minor wrongdoings, thereby curtailing their spirit. Such use on children is also problematic because as they grow changes in their appearance would make this faulty technology even more [inaccurate](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/facial-recognition-is-an-invasive-and-inefficient-tool/article28629051.ece). If a student is misidentified, they could end up having a traumatic experience which would include disciplinary action, loss of class time and potentially, [unnecessary interaction with the Police](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html) leading to a criminal record.

## Our recommendations

Therefore, we urged the DCPCR to take appropriate steps in exercise of powers under the RTE Act as well as the Commissions of Protection of Child Rights Act to ensure safeguards against violations of child rights. In particular, we urged them to consider the need for the following steps:

1. The Commission must recommend that an immediate ban should be placed on the use of facial recognition technology in schools within the territory of Delhi.
2. A review should be conducted of existing CCTV practices in schools within the territory of Delhi, including schools controlled by the Delhi Government, examining the impact on the right to privacy as well as access to education.
3. Based on the review, a privacy respecting SOP should be drafted and adopted by the Commission, to be followed by all schools under the Delhi Government.",The Delhi Govt. is using facial recognition on children in Govt. schools,Policy/Economy," Wow... This is huge... Why are we not speaking against it already... Parents, please look into it in schools your kid study at. It is wrong to even record students in classes. Schools can't protect these data and it can be misused easily. any thoughts? Isn't it scary that people no longer care about government surveillance I guess some pedo must be having fun /s. Focus your effort on the companies buying electoral bonds and shoving bio-metrics authentication.

By the way, chaddichandan gang of aadhaar infame now wants to discard fingerprint/iris authentication as many villagers got infected with corona from infected fingerprint scanners. There has to be some reason to do this.. Like kids won't be criminals on the loose or something. It's it to check attendance? And why don't we have national privacy laws like Europe?? 1984"

Vaccinate all Indians at doorstep, boot out chaddichandan gang of aadhaar infame, shut down gauwin website. No Shit. Well, the vaccines are shown to be more effective after 8 weeks, but where is evidence for this delay of 12 weeks People should be arguing as to why the government took 2-3 months to make this decision when evidence was there in Jan/Feb. But the narrative people want to put forth is incompetent government (true) delaying purposefully in spite of medical evidence. Why did they not delay 2nd dose of covaxin where the vaccine supply is low.

lefties and righties have lost it I am not a Modi and current government fan but their decision to delay vaccine by 3 months who already caught covid is well backed by science. The evidence is mounting day be day that most people who had covid has antibodies for at least 6 months and have extremely low chance to catch covid again in that interval. So vaccinating them currently is a waste. We don't have to criticise every move of the Government. [removed]"

>The company had a one-page website that does not give out much details about the group. As per Zoominfo, the company has 19 employees and a revenue of $5 million. **A Whois lookup, however, revealed that the company website was registered in 2015 by United Land Bank, headquartered at Sivan Chetty Gardens in Karnataka, India.**

Topkek. That smell. Yeah ofc LANDomus The company doesn't need to have 500B of cash right away to promise to invest 500B. If could be spread over 10 years bringing capex down to 50B per year. They could also have a DE leverage of 2, which would mean primary equity of 17B. If they can find a large primary partner to take a 50-50 stake, they'll only need half that at 8.5B. So yea you can promise to invest 500B with less than 8.5B capex per year. 

Its possible, but yeah this guy can't definitely do it lol. 500 billion USD 😂😂😂."

\- Let's be honest, our chances are slim to none but we have three more years and detoxing is a very long process so don't give up. 

\- It is indeed very emotionally taxing, especially with Indian parents but try and open up the conversation in a non-threatening way, ask them questions and be open minded. Listen to them, reflect on what they say and don't attack them. Briefly tell them about your feelings and tell them, ""let's continue this discussion later"".

nk4uce,"Halos are caused by cirrus cloudsThose thin cirrus clouds are around 20,000 feet or higher above us. They are made of tiny, ice crystals. Sunlight through the ice crystals causes the light to split, or be refracted. When at just the right angle, it causes us to see the halo.

The same thin clouds can cause a ring, or halo, around the moon at night.

Weather folklore says a ring around the sun or moon means it will rain soon. While that is not always the case, it often is actually true.  Cirrus clouds typically move into an area well ahead of a storm system that may cause rain in the next day or so.

This phenomenon lasted for almost an hour today in Bangalore. And yes, it did rain later this evening :-)",Spectacular SunHalo Sighting in Bangalore,Science/Technology," Okay, so there's another post where the OP sighted the moon halo in Jabalpur M.P, i saw the phenomenon at Nagpur, Maharashtra, you saw it in Bangalore. Was this around 8:00 PM? 

I find this weird that it was sighted at 3 different locations, I think this is because of the disturbance caused by the recent cyclone in Arabian sea, if not, what could be the reason?"

njxerv,"Hi I'm Friðrik from Iceland. I'm going to visit India next year hopefully, I already visited Delhi and Mumbai before the pandemic, I really liked both cities, people was so kind and everything I explored was amazing. That's why I'd like to visit India again as soon as I can. But besides Delhi and Mumbai: which other cities you recommend me to visit? I plan to visit as many spots as possible so yougo ahead if you want to recommend me some places :)

Thanks in advance",Which places of India should I visit next year?,AskIndia," Start from east India 

1. Kolkata - great for food, history (it was the capital on India under British), museums, architecture etc. 

2. SUnderbans - it’s a mangrove forest and you get an opportunity to spot Royal Bengal Tigers. 

3. Darjeeling and Gangtok - Hill stations with a Buddhist monasteries and lovely dimsums. 

Southern Indian 

1. Start from Chennai
2. Pondicherry - French colony 
3. Go to Kanyakumari  - tip of India 
4. Finish off in Kerala - live in a boathouse in the backwaters. 

Northern India (not recommending as you’re from Iceland and have mountainous terrain there) 

1. Amritsar - food, golden temple, visit the India- pak border 

2. Move North to Himachal Pradesh - Old Manali, Kasaul, Tosh and Parvati valley trek. These are beautiful treks with breath taking views of the Himalayas. If you’re smoke up, you can get the one of the best hash in the world - Malana cream. 

3. If you have time visit Kashmir if possible 

There are many other places to visit as India is huge. I would recommend Mysore, Shravanabelagola, Hampi (These are in my state of Karnataka). Sun temple in Konark in Orissa. Also north east India and Kerala is beautiful I’ve heard. I haven’t had the chance to visit yet. Manali, Coonoor, Bangalore, Lakshadweep Islands, Varanasi, Kashmir, Cherapunji. Hey in case covid situation gets better and hopefully we are over it, then pls do visit.


I believe you should  target old cities of india and that will add new angle to your journey with very different beliefs and cultures to be seen. I recommend something different. Visit national forests. Corbett. Kaziranga, Sikkim. Do a bike trip through Konkan, find a partner though. End in Goa. Don’t bother coming here friend, it’s a total and absolute mess and will probably still be next year. Go to Sri Lanka or Nepal, or even Thailand or someplace where the people are nicer and chiller and more honest. Don't assume that India will be vaccinated by next year. Our central government is a joke. Don't. Trust me. I would say wait at least 3 more years then visit India because the covid situation is just going to get worse and we don't have proper infrastructure to deal with it and neither a whole billion population is getting vaccinated anytime soon. Also the virus is mutating and even if you are vaccinated, you can still contract it.  So if you can, please wait for few more years and then tour the country. 1. Are you fit in Traveller or Tourist? These both terms are opposite to each other (if you already know the difference). If you let know I may suggest accordingly.

2. What is your intended time of stay in India? Let me know before you travel next year, I can suggest you some places up north if you like the idea of home stays."

Btw, I'm a Hindu by birth.

This question came to my mind upon reading this news. This is all well and good, but the country should not be left at mercy of rich corporations/individuals deciding to spend a part of their wealth on worthy causes. They should be appropriately taxed, and the money used for common good. This includes closing corporate loopholes, including those for religious businesses. Isn't building hospitals the responsibility of the government.... Isn't that the reason we pay taxes.... Now even this has become a social responsibility to build your own hospitals and schools.... Hopefully the schools don't spend time teaching religion. The figured this out now ? Please don't waste money on hospitals and health infrastructure.

Beautiful locations. Muslim population is 90% so no fallout for the regime. 

You could be right.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/india) if you have any questions or concerns.* The content itself is fine, but ToIletpaper needs to be shut down just for this part of the headline: ""Will this one spread fast like corona?""

Fuckwits, this is an opportunistic infection that is showing up in covid patients with comorbidities like diabetes who may have been given steroids. The only thing that can increase this thing's spread is increasing the density of spores by stupid things like bathing in and eating cow shit. And that stupidity is spreading, thanks to the ruling party and its parivar.  Otherwise, we're all exposed to the normal level of its spores.

The article uses inflamatory headline, and doesn't address the only known plausible cause that can increase the rate of black fungus. Shame. WOW. there is a reason it is called Toiletoaper Of India. TOI.

This is fungus that is already inside our bodies. For this to happen to someone, that individual needs to get Streoids during Covid and also needs to have diabetes! Which btw lowers your immunity and lets the already present fungus to multiply uninhibited! 

This won't spread!! It's a fungus and not a virus!!! It doesn't spread as such, but numbers can increase as Covid cases increase. It won't. Lol. Will it spread like corona. Bhai thoda effort laga ke kisi medical field ke aadmi se 2 min he baat kar liya karo before printing things like these and initiating panic. its not expected to spread as an average healthy human already has a highly potent immune response to this infection.. as a result, the market size is believed to be small and existing production capacity for counteracting drugs is geared towards meeting this limited demand..

also these drugs are priced higher to compensate for small market size as investors have to recoup investments made in r&d and other assets

.. now covid induced black fungus is expected to have a multiplicative impact on this market.. it would be irrational to assume that private players would benevolently invest in permanent expansion of capacity to accommodate what would at best be a temporary spurt in demand.. so there's no option but for government to heavily subsidize new investments & provide coverage for speculative inventory  build up..else production might not pick up"

njuhz3,"Doubtlessly, many Indians, hate or atleast have an animosity against the British, even though the oppressors are long dead.   


Honestly, I don’t hate the British, but I really hate the attitude of many English people of not acknowledging their ancestors’ mistakes. I was recently browsing through thr Quora page about Bengal Famine, for which Winston Churchill was indeed, or atleast partly responsible. Whenever we report against such atrocities, the British people get extremely and unneccesarily defensive. They continuously blame something else for the atrocity. I saw one English guy literally blaming Subhash Chandra Bose and the Japanese for the Bengal Famine when clearly Churchill was partly responsible! What is this attitude?   


When indeed the evidence points that indeed the British were responsible, they beat the bush and say that ”India is poor”, “...You guys should rather feed your millions of BPL people“, etc. etc., they constantly defend themselves.   


What do you guys think?",Why I still tend to dislike the British even though the oppressers are long dead,Non-Political," The British don't teach much about their colonial history in school. Tbh there isn't much postive that they could say. And its only natural that countries wouldn't want to talk about the darker parts of their history. Bring up Kashmir in our conversations and people immediately get defensive too. Its always difficult talking about history when one was the oppressor. The effect is still here in so many countries. I guess it's involuntary defensive nature that comes naturally to most humans. They necessarily don't mean bad, and most times it's diverting from it, more than denying it. 




Maybe I'm being lenient here, but it's not too different than almost anyone being pointed out their mistakes on a dinner table or something like that. 




But yeah, nothing wrong in acknowledging history. After all, it was their ancestors and not them. Even back then, the leaders did things the populace of their own nation never agreed with. There was no internet or anything like that, so people never knew much about other nations' people. The common man wants to discover and make friends, not fight. The Israel-Palestine conflict which is another consequence of colonialism, is being widely protested by the Brits. Leave those bigots be. They ain't worth your precious time. They are about to drown led by the very talented gujjuben. Churchill was not just partly responsible, he was the main decisionmaker. And he was a racist politician who seriously had nothing but disgust for the Indian leaders, even Gandhi. Just a thought,... When south africa accused Ghandhi of being racist did you feel defensive or not? I'll tell you what I felt... Indifferent. 
Churchill may not get forgiveness for the Bengal famine. 
But do you think if subhash Chandra Bose succeeded in fighting the British with Japanese and German help that we would now be somehow better? Very ignorant bunch."

This seems to be an Indian company tegistered in Bangalore which has opened up an office in US. Not sure what their angle is, but they are probably not even worth USD 5B. 


This is their details in India, same directors.

If i assume just 25% of  the amount goes to benefit the bureaucracy (as an incentive to do the job they already get paid for), that would total to $125 billion.

1. Government can ask private schools to waive their tuition fee as a charitable act or encourage big corporates to sponsor education of such children as a part of their CSR.


2. Government can start a boarding educational facility for such children. Bring back the Gurukul system.


3. Government can make provision for monthly fixed payment to such kids for their living expenses.


4. Government in collaboration with various NGOs can make a huge difference.


5. Not just education, but government must ensure skill development as well. With proper training and skill development these children will become eligible for various employment opportunities which in t8urn would  make them financially independent.

Don't try to understand their points or reason with them because if they cared about your mental health they would have stopped long time ago.

Focus on yourself, you are not your parents and you know your children will never have to go through this. They have decided their priorities and you shoud too.

 Got selected for their Fellowship this year. But I chose to join another Fellowship because it aligned better with my career goals(was working with a health tech startup earlier)Anyway, from what I know about them so far, they genuinely care about the kids they teach. 

I don't think they'll spam you or anything but I am not sure if you can volunteer online to teach kids since they found from last year's data that an online teaching model wasn't helping the underprivileged kids they work with, due to a lot of issues like non availability of devices, poor internet connection and things like that. So the best way to mentor these kids would be to work with them in person and you can definitely do that after covid subsides. You should contact the Teach for India office in your city and enquire about volunteering opportunities. Muje padha do Saar, Aapke badle bchho ko m 4 ghante padhauhga."
njjbap,"It's been over a year since I entered the final chapter of my school life. I remember being all exited about it last year in March just before our session began in April. 

Never got to attend a single physical class the entire year. It's really hard for someone like me- who suffers from anxiety and has only a handful of friends-to stay away from school for a year. Millions of other students across this country suffered the same fate. None of us got to enjoy even a bit of our final year in school. 

Not a single person is talking about the toll it's taken on us. Sure, there are bigger problems everyone needs to deal with rn. That's understandable. But what would it take for someone- anyone- to show a tiny bit of empathy for us and what we have been going through mentally for the past year? In fact, we're still going through so much. 

A year of online education, for an average student like me, was as productive as one can expect. It's not like I didn't try. I did. I just couldn't cope. I don't know if there are others like me but I sure as hell know that personally, online classes have done nothing for me even though my teachers have done their best. 

However, I wouldn't mind the exams. Sure, personally, I might not like the decision but I will go along with it. But that's it. There needs to be *a* decision first. 

A lot of the students have lost their parents or other loved ones. Yet, they are being subjected to this bombardment of news about conducting or not conducting the final exams. Just decide FFS! We're tired. Please. This is getting too much now. Just make a decision. Please. Let us get some mental peace now. 

My parents are in a tough spot financially. I'm so stressed that I've completely messed up my sleep schedule. I've lost my appetite. I start crying suddenly. Please. Don't subject us to this madness. Just make a decision- any decision- and let us move on from our worst year of academic life.",I'm A Class 12 Student And I'm So Fucking Tired.,Non-Political," I’m a college student but I can relate to what you’re going through. I find it astounding how the mental toll of the pandemic on students (in schools and colleges alike) has hardly been discussed by the politicians/media. In the US and the UK, the concerns of the students have been a prominent part of the discourse. In India, all we have is static silence except for that one time where there was a discussion on holding the JEE. It feels like nobody in positions of power cares about the mental toll of the pandemic on students. 

Please note, I’m not demanding solutions. I know it’s an incredibly complex issue to navigate. But at least some discourse would be appropriate OP! Try reaching out to your classmates , I am a class 12 student too and for the most part didn't have many close friends but almost all of us are depressed rn,so just ring them up ,people will be willing to talk.. and yeah like FR i want exams to be cancelled I just fucking think it's moronic they are even considering these things rn but well.. the averages indian parent and trophy child survives on marks.. like honestly fuck this culture... And try to work out OP it did help . Im also in the same boat mate :/ The Pandemic has ruined the lives of our youth. Even the west is struggling to come to terms with the social loss we've collectively experienced and little is known how the Pandemic will effect our upcoming adults. I empathize with your situation and can only offer you one advice.

Don't cut yourself off due to habit. Keep productive and always keep yourself occupied. Look into projects you and your friends could do beyond your academic business to maintain your camaraderie. You are young, use the time to enjoy your youth.

Try doing something like learning a new language (your state's language?) Together. Or trying to neutralize your accent through regular conversational practice. Set up a reading club. Learn a new skill like video editing or web development for you never know when it comes useful as you grow up. Set up a podcast where you and your friends discuss things you have a common interest in (like Suniel Shetty films for example). Learn useless but cool skills like juggling or magic tricks or to perform the swing dance moves - that stuff might just help you in college xD.

Life might look bleak, but there's a lot you can do to spice it up. I remember back when I was in 12th grade. We had no pandy around us, but we still had a constant seige mentality surrounding us because of the academic rat race and parental pressure. Take care and cheer up. All the best! I feel for you..
Seriously people are not talking about how hard this is. I feel like starting a youtube channel on coping with the pandemic emotionally.

Its also been hella hard for people to work right now.. everything truly is fucked and people are shaming people more for being scared...It's fuc ked :( 

I'm so fuc king tired I swear.

We need to start talking about this ... Mental health is such a joke in India... I wanna help.. I am so empathetic I feel like I feel everyones feelings... I feel pain . And sadness and lots of frustration...

How can I help? What can we all do to help... I can relate here dear stranger. Even I suffer from anxiety and frankly speaking the last one and a half year has been miserable for me. I have literally wasted an year of my engineering life. It is difficult for me to attend online classes. The lockdown has taken a huge toll on me. 



Apart from anxiety, I am suffering from chronic diarrohea but thanks to COVID, other patients are not able to consult doctors now.



Hopefully, this too shall pass. If it helps, I am also someone who suffers from anxiety from time to time. My graduate admissions and plans to go abroad for a master's got absolutely derailed due to this pandemic. I quit my shitty ass job thinking , finally, it would be over and well, since there are literally no seats left I got fcked yet again. Everyone has their own problems my dude. I know how this feels, all this uncertainty. 

You will get through this though. Just hang in there. 12th / 10 th is already tiring and stressful without a pandemic. I mean 12 and JEE were the worst days of my life. Even few years back, when I was in 12th, after every exam like JEE or NEET some students would commit suicide, even tho that hit the national news, no one ever seriously addressed how stressful and hard on mental health these this are. I remember some dude saying that todays children aren't just strong enough. It's insane how some people see nothing wrong with the education system I gave 12^th boards many years ago. The syllabus was just too much to deal with. You don't understand concepts even in classroom and many subjects aren't useful in real life. Class 12 - Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Maths are each 350 pages books. How is anyone able to remember and understand everything?

Anyways, I'm thinking about building better education board. It won't be possible to register education board, but there needs to be better alternative.

Think about it - if we could build better education system, it could improve thousands of lives! I'm going to give my 10th boards in 2022. I don't know how the future pattern of board exams is going to be like - everything is messed up. My close friend just lost her only parent a month ago from covid.  
I wonder what she will do with her boards now (have no contact w her,she won't let us)  
As for me,I think I was depressed until I started using discord.Its not the same as irl interaction but it keeps me going."
nk0gsf,"One of my relative was infected by Corona virus almost a month back and he has fully recovered now. As with most of Indian cases, RT-PCR test was not done (Rapid Antigen was done for which positive report was conveyed verbally) and hence no govt record of him infected with corona. Now, he wants to get vaccinated. Govt in India has mandated that anyone who got infected with virus should be vaccinated after 3 months. Anyone who's following Indian response to the covid knows that 3 months cool off period is nothing to do with any scientific evidence but on govt inability to provide vaccine. So I've following question regarding this:
1. What is the practice around the world for administering AstraZeneca/Covishield vaccine to people who were infected with Corona virus ?
2. Is there any authentic study of cooling off time period ?

Calling this a business is an insult to all businesses. GR2BR. Surely he must have had enough of coronil and gomutra ark at his disposal. Someone must be chewing his words.

njygbu,"I was just wondering that opportunist people who use current situation to get rich or make money. I mean how much greed a person can get. I feel embarrassed to admit that few of my close known people are among these. I just can't understand what you will do with all that money if all the people surrounded are struggling even to survive. 

What about the self-centred people who doesn't care about public or others in general. I mean yeah, money is essential. But how long can you survive only with money, right ??
You need people with whom you can cherish your feelings, share your thoughts, express yourself, communicate and all those stuff.
I mean this material world has gone far behind greed line. 

Big gaints pharmaceutical companies who doesn't want to share the procedure/recipe (I don't know the exact term) and infact want to patent those are like bloody blood suckers. I believe one shouldn't earn more than in one could spend in his/her lifetime.  It's same like food, you can have upto some limit. After that you can't or shouldn't have. 

I'm going nuts by listening to very close people getting affected by Covid-19 and just want to vent out few things. 

And comes these retards who create, share fake news regarding vaccine. Now myself can't convince lot of people to get vaccine.

I am sure saying ""hey if you need something let me know"" won't work because they are in a state of shock. 

I feel some people might be in my situation who want to try to help those who are grieving but have no clue. Maybe this post can help us understand what could be done especially in this covid situation.

[She's also written some basic guidelines here.](https://refugeingrief.com/helper-overview/) This post is hitting hard during these times. Quite a few close friends lost one of their parents during the past few weeks of lockdown in Delhi. They were people I knew for almost all my life. But then hearing the news about their passing from our church Whatsapp group was a shock. Didn't even know that they got sick. Most cases the sickness and death occured within 5 days. 

Mummy called up the deceased spouses while I messaged their kids. Didn't know how to talk or what to say. Normally one could go to their home and join in the prayers and offer condolences and support face to face. But now due to Covid being the cause of death that is out. Offering the same condolences on phone feels awkward. Not calling makes you feel guilty. 

This is by far the worst month ever in my life. My family here and extended family in Kerala are fine. But knowing that people who were also like family here are dead and I couldn't even see them once at the end is truly heartbreaking."
nj4svd,"I'm a doctor, and just wanted to rant here.

Since the last week , there have been many  accusations made against medical professionals in India, and we have seen the emergence of Pseudoscience -- whether it's the eyedrops to treat covid in Nellore to Ramdev's statements about how allopathy resulted in deaths. I'll try to make a few points here, will try to be as respectful as possible :

&#x200B;

1. "" I got COVID, just stayed home and used coronil , and I recovered within a week! Didn't use a single western medicine and I was still fine ! SEE, all these allopathy are fake!!''

This is probably the most common accusation/statement made by most of the population, and its the most laughable one too.

Look, nearly 90% of patients with COVID recover. They will not need oxygen, ventilator, steroids or Tocilizumab. They simply recover. So in a hypothetical scenario where a person got Covid, I make up a new branch of medicine called ""XYZopathy"", and I prescribe the random COVID positive guy to sleep with his socks on and hit himself on his head with a twig everyday at 8:32 am sharp while shouting    "" Tsamina mina, eh eh "" -- guess what, there's nearly 90% chance he will get cured within a week - not because of the ridiculous 'treatment' I prescribed, but because he would've gotten better thanks to his immune system anyways. that's called 'Placebo' = and that's what happens in every patient prescribed these non-allopathic medications.  You can literally prescribe Butter chicken and naan as a a treatment! Look how fun (and stupid) it is?

2.   "" Huh! my friend used 'insert random homeopathic tablet' and recovered fine. on the other hand look at all those big hospitals where people are dying like flies in ICUs. Homeopathy >>> allopathy frands""

This is probably the most idiotic statement I've ever heard. Does anyone understand the difference between the two cohorts of ""general population"" and "" Hospital ICU""? Those in the ICU are the most critical patients of all - On ventilators, ECMOs, In Cytokine storm where the body is essentially attacking itself with inflammatory cytokines- they have a much higher mortality rate as the baseline than the ""friend who took the homeopathic tablets''. Those in ICU's are more likely to die than those in the general population - that's the reason they're in an ICU in the first place!

Simply put - would it be okay if doctors in ICUs stop using steroid and tocilizumab to treat ARDS and cytokine storm and instead use homeopathic sugar pills? there would rightfully be a freak-out.

Also the reason why people are dying is due to lack of oxygen, beds, ventilators, Tocilizumab - in other words literally due to lack of allopathy, not due to it. If there were just more Beds, Oxygen and ventilators - thousands of life could've been saved.

&#x200B;

3. The promotion of pseudoscience to treat ailments is genuinely dangerous -- there is a common myth about how allopathy causes many side effects while homeo n co dont.

I'll give a tiny anecdotal experience - during my rural postings, I was posted in a RHC where every tuesday used to be 'BP day' - essentially many people from  surrounding villages come and get their BPs measured. And guess what- There were multiple cases where there were old patients who were hypertensives - but they literally didn't believe they were because they were using some sugar pills. There was this guy - some 70 years old - and I still remember measuring his BP and it was 200/120. My eyes popped out - This was essentially a hypertensive urgency - immediate treatment needed or there's a risk of stroke/kidney failure/heart failure would've occured. and guess what - he literally didn't believe he was in an emergency situation. After all he was taking 'em sugar pills - how could they not work? I convinced him to take tablet and go to a bigger hospital immediately.

The reason why I've shared this is because - guess what will happen to all these elderly hypertensives in due time ? they will very probably get a stroke or a heart attack or a PAD. Guess who will have to bear the brunt of death if it happens? Allopathics - because of course the Pseudoscience followers will never take up or try to treat a case of heart attack. Why? that thing literally doesn't work. They know it as well as I do.

essentially what happens is - the pseudoscience graduates prescribe snake oil for conditions which are extremely treatable in the initial stages, and when complications ultimately arise, it's the Allopaths who have to step in.

why does R\*mdev and his sidekick b\*lkrishna regularly get admitted in AIIMS? Why does every MP and Minister in Delhi right now have a guaranteed bed in AIIMS DELHI with a ventilator, Oxygen and even an ECMO machine if needed ,, while You and I are probably gonna die if we get pneumonia? Will ministers promoting AYUSH ever dare to go to Ramdev's hospital for treatment instead of AIIMS? Even the most fervent believers in AYUSH know the answer.

And simply put, that should be the question asked to the government -- Why is it that we don't have the same access to medical facilities as you, and why don't you follow the same medical treatments  whichyou promote to the masses. But it's simply easier to attack a random doctor who's dehydrated in his PPE suit after a 24 - 36 hour shift - and that is what Indians will continue to do.

Sorry for the long rant.",Ayurveda vs Allopathy ; A Doctor's perspective.,Coronavirus," My sympathies with you. I can't imagine how frustrating it must be to see a new ""miracle cure"" making the rounds on WhatsApp everyday. Also - it is a fucking joke that homeopathy is given legitimacy in our country by being the ""H""  in the Ministry of AYUSH. The existence of ""government recognized"" homoeopathic colleges of ""medicine"" is a tax payer funded hoax! It's disgusting to see the clout that snake oil salesmen like Ramdev enjoy. And after all the blood and toil the front line workers are doing, Mudiji shamelessly puts up his image on the  vaccines. :/

Edit:
I think one of the possible reasons why many of the older people have been taking to these alternative medicines --with out discounting the damage done by the politicians and Babas --  could be due to the commercialization of the healthcare industry in the cities. My dad had developed a tumor and later also had a heart surgery (unrelared), and I've personally experienced the downsides of corporate healthcare systems. For example, one of the doctors, at a high end hospital who first operated on his tumor fucked it up slightly and never bothered to tell us about it. Since the tumor was in a really precarious position near the spine, they shouldn't have even taken up the option of surgery in the first place. After much searching, we finally found an excellent doctor at Tata memorial who has been seeing him for the last 15 years and really helped him recover with radiotherapy and minimal medication. But for every one good doctor like the one we found at Tata memorial, there are hundreds of other who will happily put the patient under the knife to extort more cash. One of the doctors my dad had seen before going to Tata memorial was this doctor from HCG, a highly rated cancer hospital in Bangalore. The doctor who saw him was so insistent on surgery that he'd call him every two days and emotionally manipulate him saying that he's like his son and wants to help him and that if he doesn't get the surgery done now, he shouldn't call the doctor later because it'd be too late, etc. . 

So over the years, I've seen how my parents have begun to lose trust in the goodness of the medical system that's available to them. And although I staunchly support the doctors and sane voices who are against alternative medicines whenever any argument about this comes up with my parents, I can understand where my parents are coming from.

And this isn't just the one experience, I worked with an online healthcare company that aggregates doctors and specialists, and the primary complaint of the patients was how doctors in even the best hospitals treat patients very poorly, often resort to unethical methods to extract cash, and are happy to prescribe unnecessary medicines because they get a cut from the pharma companies, or will perform an unnecessary surgery to meet the hospital's targets. 

Obviously none of this absolves Ramdev and his ilk from the crime of misinforming and deceiving the public. But there may be another side to the story - especially in cities. I'm sure that there is some trust deficit that hospitals and doctors ought to fix. To quote Tim Minchin:
""Alternative medicine, by definition, has either not been proved to work or has been proved not to work.
You know what they call alternative medicine that has been proved to work? Medicine.""

This is much needed, thanks Doctor. 
The problem in india is that allopathy is viewed as ""western"" and how can anything from the west be superior to our Desi medicine. Though the weird irony is that Homeopathy is German, so can't really understand it's popularity it india.
A secondary issue is the politics associated with traditional medicine, to question Ayurveda is tantamount to saying ""I hate India"" Well said, doc. Dont be sorry, it was a great read. I'm gonna save it.

Also, you're doing an amazing job, please don't let those dweebs discourage you. I know it's way easier for me to sit in the comfort of my home and type on Reddit, and it's very difficult to actually go out there and do stuff, but seriously, keep it going. Despite so much danger, not just from the virus, but also from aggressive patients and families, the medical community is doing fantastic work. Takes guts of steel.

As a token of appreciation, please accept my free award. It's nothing, but know that all of us on this sub are aware of what healthcare workers are going through, and we appreciate every bit of what you're doing for us all. [deleted] I absofrinkinlutely appreciate your post. Moreover I believe homeopathy medicines also work on placebo effect. They just taste better than any other medicine. Stop calling real medicine allopathy MD medicine here. Agree so hard. The double standard and brutal disregard for science, research and life in favour of religion is insane.

 I've seen patients get Ayurvedic bhasmas that have arsenic to cure diseases and end up with heavy metal toxicity.

Then we have ayuquacks touting treatments for ulcerative colitis and cancer with absolutely no scientific backing. Ignore the morons bro. Let them catch some disease next and let them treat it with Ayurveda or cow dung or whatever. When even simplest of fever will become fatal, only then these morons will learn. Totally agree. Part of the reason is also for some ailments there is no cure and doctors are not gods. The vast majority of the population does not understand that and expects miracles. Since 99% of people don't have a clue about physiology and how bodies work, they get taken up by quacks who promise a cure where there is none. And even some cancers regress spontaneously so if someone is taking quack medicine will attribute it and spread it around. Most people don't realize or know that causation is no correlation.

Think. Indians.  Think. Finally some magazine has the guts to call him out! Before Covid, no one forced him (just a little force) to make decisions & that's why everyone praised him as a strong and decisive leader, but now, after Covid, he is being forced to make a  lot of decision and most of the decision he made, is just absurd, crazy, illogical or garbage. This pandemic has further solidified the notion that Modi is just a scumbag politician who only cares for votes and can go to any extent to maintain the hold on power!! Strong?

nj61l8,"Hi 
I am a doctor based in Delhi . I am seeing a Keralite doctor for the past 1 year . His internalised homophobia makes him very uneasy when we spend more time with each other . We repeatedly break up as he says gays cannot survive in India . Everything is lost to them ..society, family , children . But simultaneously he is not able to muster the courage to say yes for marrying a woman . I guess his conscience stops him . 

Of late he has revealed his reality to his elder sister but she seems to be very orthodox in her approach ..suggesting singledom over a gay partnership. She thinks it is unimaginable for two guys to stay together in Kerala . The social stigma would be too much .Leave alone having a baby through surrogacy and all that .

I was just looking for some well settled gay couples in Delhi and India to please extend their helping hand in giving confidence to my dear friend that gay life need not be a cursed life .

He also agreed to go to counselling sessions. So any recommendations on that front would also be welcome .

All in all, I really need help to salvage this situation . Its been 3 broken relationships already and this 4th one is also being so full of hurt . Please help .",Any gay couples in India on guiding how to make it work ?,AskIndia," Same suggestion as I would to any couple - do not consider marriage unless all issues are resolved. You two could settle in a more anonymous large metro. A few heartbreaks are nothing compared to a lifetime with a conflicted person. Couples counselling is a great idea but find a lgbt friendly one. Indian counsellors can be absolutely orthodox most of the time. It can be scary. I know a couple from my college who live together and have even had kids through surrogacy. But they do live in Delhi and come from very liberal families, and have been dating each other since school. 

So I do think if you guys relocate to a big city then it might be easier. I don't know but upvoted for better visibility Please take this with a grain of salt as I am no expert on this matter, but I would suggest you both do some form of couples therapy or counseling, as it could be of major help to release his internalised homophobia. I would also suggest you join LGBT  support groups in your area if there are, as they can be helpful in making him feel accepted and maybe even guide on how to come out to his family

Edit: also post on r/lgbtindia might get more helpful responses there Kerala is not socially friendly for LGBT folks. 

Surprisingly, the North is (India today Data). So delhi is the best option. Hi! Gay woman living with partner in a fairly cosmopolitan city. You should try moving to a city like this(Mumbai, Pune, etc), get apartments close-by, and try to work it out. Lifelong commitment is scary stuff and should only come after basic issues are resolved Not a guy or gay but I know an older (35) bisexual guy in Delhi. He tells me that the lgbtq scene in Delhi is nice, he’s met plenty of men on OND. 

At the end of the day, don’t put your energy into someone that doesn’t deserve it. You live your life ♥️ Im not very experienced regarding this but I believe larger cities have more woke and understanding people, as the now youth and generation is open to these stuff everyone is getting smarter. Moving to Mumbai / Delhi can be a good option hi from London. I know Delhi a tiny bit, and have met some cool gay people there; I'd suggest you connect with a scene. I straight up just googled 'delhi lgbt' and came up with loads of useful links and support groups. if you stay with this partner (which may not be possible if his internalised homophobia is too toxic for this relationship) then he would do well to meet other gay people in India - there are thousands! - just to normalise his self-perception. Therapy is a good idea - again, just google it! I have a transgender friend.

Coming from them - surrounds yourself with like-minded individuals. In large cities, there are lgbt+ support groups - where you meet other lgbt+ individuals who are financially and socially secure and can uplift any individuals needing help.

Having allies is great. But having an in-community support system is a must.

And not just for practical support but also emotional one. Having other people around you, like you, provides enormous relief and prevents depressive thoughts. If you cannot do that, at least find online support groups.

Also, many older older lgbt+ folks can give you life-advice specific to your situations. You cannot think about important life decisions out of fear and feeling lonely. Both of you need to make decisions in a healthy environment. I wanna say be shameless and live your life with your dude.. but i also know how fuxking scary india can be...
I really hope that one day we can fearlessly be ourselves and do what makes us happy..
If i find myself a girl (I'm a girl) and I want her..Im going to screw everything and be with her.. no matter what people say..

Hopefully I can set an example for others and help normalise it in our country... It would be scary.. but maybe better to live with your love happy and a bit scared rather than live feeling scared and unhappy anyway..."

njtexd,"Hello. I'm a 10th class student who is researching Subhas Chandra Bose for a small, non-school related project. But I am confused about some things:

1. What did he do in the time he spent in Nazi Germany?
2. What did he do in the time spent in Imperial Japan?
3. Why wasn't he criticised by anyone for siding with the Axis Powers during World War 2? (I do not mean that as a sign of disrespect to Bose, but I was very interested in this fact)
4. What was his relationship with Mahatma Gandhi?

Thank you!",I am confused about the history of Subhas Chandra Bose,History ," In 1940 Bose was jailed because of his anti-colonial activitie but he declared fasting to death if not released. The British then put him in a house arrest to avoid more protests but Bose managed to escape (in his popular Wanderer W27 car). On his way to Germany he did stay a while in Soviet Russia hoping to get aid from them but the negotiations didn't go well.

While in Germany he founded the Free India Legion alongwith Indian sepoys who fought for the British in Africa before they were captured by the Nazis. The soldiers swore - ""I swear by God this holy oath that I will obey the leader of the German race and state, Adolf Hitler as the commander of the German armed forces in the fight for India, whose leader is Subhas Chandra Bose.""
This should clarify that Nazi Germany had little to nothing to do with India's freedom they only used them as puppets.
Bose was also a socialist and had a bias towards the USSR, when the Germans attacked Soviet he was devasted and realized the true intentions of Hitler.

With Japan however they managed to gain some victories the Eastern territories captured by Japan helped as a bastion. The first Indian army administered for an Indian cause ""Azad Hind Fauj"" stationed in Burma pushed to Imphal and Kohima and other north eastern territories. The Japanese however having lost in the war to the allied forces retreated. Bose while returning to Japan was killed in a plane crash in Farmosa (now Taiwan).
In a nutshell you can say the Japanese helped India albeit for a short time.

A lot of people criticised him including Gandhi however that is not to say that the relations between these two personalities were hostile or contradictory as some try to portray. Gandhi only criticised him for getting help from opressors to alleviate India's oppression. The modern Congress is especially targeted and conspired against for political reasons, the truth however is that they only kept a distance from Netaji because of their obvious differences in ideologies (differences not contradictions). These are some good questions you asked mate. I don't know and not qualified enough to answer your questions. Although, whatever he did with the Axis powers was minuscule and insignificant compared to grand scheme of things.

He was not criticized because a few thousand men and women he was able to gather for his Legion didn't matter in the bigger picture."

I don't want this to be a political discussion. I am a data scientist who is studying potential super spreader events and how to minimize exposure of potential participants. I have painfully been made aware of the fact that people do not care about the question, "" if is it right to hold a mass gathering in the midst of a second wave?"" 

So, the only question I am going to ask is : 

What precautions could we take to reduce the risk of protesters and police who could potentially be exposed to the virus?",What is your opinion of the farmer's protest scheduled for May 26?,Coronavirus," * [Covid-19 Megathread for Discussions is live here>>](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/n1plmu/coronavirus_covid19_discussion_megathread_9/)

1) Organizers need to request vaccine passports to participants.

2) Double masking and social distancing measures need to be strictly followed and violaters need to be kicked out of the protest by organizers.

3) Mandatory zone-wise 14-day quarantines for people before they can return home.

4) Mandatory RT-PCR tests for people before attending the meeting and RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests for a random sample (at least 10% of participants every day). If the positivity rate crosses 5%, the protest should be canceled and participants should be quarantined. The necessity of the farmers protests at hand cannot not ignored and hence the politicization of the issue can't be stalled.

On the other side, considering Covid, the basic procedures of COVID appropriate behaviour must be enforced. All protestors should make sure that they are following social distancing, and wearing masks. If possible face shields should be used as well. Temperatures of the protestors coming to the event and maintaining a register of their medical and travel history. 

Assuming a lot of the farmers coming there won't have been vaccinated previously, a tent for that purpose may be established, so that a vaccination drive can be accomplished side by side the protest. 

My points are besides the ones you have stated and I have tried to consider the necessity of the farmer's protest while making sure that it doesn't become a super spreader event. Another option is to split the protesters into smaller groups (groups of 5) and enforce physical distancing between the groups by assigning places for them to protest at. This would make it easier to trace the primary contacts in case of infections. While watching the protests on TV, I have noticed so many farmers not wearing masks..this could get deadly. I don't understand why can't they follow protocol."
njwt84,"Hi all, I want to know your insights about how to make the first move which texting someone, I have spent a lot of time without being in touch with my friends and now I am finding it difficult to have a convo. going with them.

It's always me starting the convo. and actually, I am fed up with being the first one to initiate things, I thought stopping it would help but no one actually texts me first. Even if I text first the convo would be over in few lines. 

I think I am not doing it rightly, so it would be great if you could provide me with some pointers. Please be specific.",How to start a conversation with friends?,AskIndia," We have to understand that is okay to initiate a conversation because we feel we need to talk to someone. It's perfectly natural and there's nothing ""needy"" about it. No place for ego.

Once that is sorted if we don't get responses or get forced responses from the other side, maybe we need to make new friends with shared interests which we can discuss. Like politics, or sports.

Memes are great conversation starters but in the end it's the shared interests which drive the conversation. Who initiates should not really matter. Send a meme ig ? Or just be open and ask ""Hey, its been a while, what're you upto these days (name) ?"" Don't mean to be harsh, but there's a chance they're not interested F on a national sub nonetheless."

It means that whenever someone is determined to either die or be injured from a vaccine, the company is liable for paying compensation.

Not sure if the Sputnik guys agreed to this clause.

I have seen 11 deaths[10 men and 1 woman, all over 65+] die on various days after taking their first or second dose of vaccine. All of them died in their sleep, and all of them were certified to have died from some vague heart problem.

It is easy to want the advantages of a liberal society without doing any if the hard work. You gave answer in ur question itself.

""Don't change anything""

Follow that mantra, cause any taboo is only taboo if you accept it. Don't accept it, and change as per other people's perception. Simple. Just talk about it. With your parents, siblings, friends. The more you talk, the less taboo it becomes. How? You don't. Be born in a liberal family and live your life happily Is it really that big of a taboo anymore? A lot has changed between now and say 2010. I am one of the few people in my social circle who doesn't use online dating apps (find them stupid and cringe honestly). I don't think I know too many girls who haven't been in a relationship yet. Whether there was sex involved or not is their personal thing. A taboo is still there, not denying that, especially with the older generation and rural areas, however the situation has definitely changed a lot. I mean I don't expect my parents to talk freely about it but  my friends can. We are the future so the taboo is slowly but surely losing its foothold in indian culture. 

And what kind of effort do you want people to put in? Sex ed is important but that's less to do with taboo and more to do with men not becoming rapists. 

Also do know this kind of thing takes time, there is no one thing you can do to suddenly convince them to oppose their convictions. You can't show a video to your parents or your relatives to make them think in a different way, like a switch. I find it funny that why nri are always so concerned about India . Why not mind what’s going on in your own country ?

And regarding taboo it’s not that much of a taboo anymore but I also think we don’t need kind of culture that America has when it comes to dating . Wouldn't you want that u/doglover549 There are ways
 
1) modi ji having an affair and it gets prime time spot on national TV, your parents won't be minding you having a partner than 🤭

2)if you are LGBTQ, and if the nation finds out modi ji didnt get married coz he loves amit the social stigma on LGBTQ would disappear the very moment all the LGBTQ's would live happily ever after.🤣😋 Simple. Don't date at all. You're being saved from all the hassle.

njuxo3,"We all know that better standards of living, amenities, roads, healthcare, infrastructure, education, housing etc exist in first world countries. But what I am curious about is the dating life, social life and community of those of us currently living abroad or have lived abroad and I have a few aspects of life for you guys if you could elaborate on. I have added some questions to help the answers be elaborated a bit.

1. Dating: How has your dating life been affected since moving abroad? Are you doing better or worse compared to India? How are you received by foreigners? Is there a prejudice to you being Indian or brown or do just the usual ""be attractive/don't be unattractive"" rule applies? 

2. Social life: How have your social life changed? Is your social life more active or worse? Travel, hobbies, hanging out, pubs...what exactly constitutes your social life? Is it better or worse than in India?

3. Community: Whats your sense of community? Do you feel more accepted than in India or are you viewed as an outsider? Any overt or covert racism that you face? Are your social interactions deeper or shallower than compared to the ones you had in India? Do you feel more or less lonely compared to India? What's it like having different ethinicities interact with each other...open and bonding or shallow and judgmental? 

I am in a weird place where I feel I don't belong in India but I feel I don't belong in a foreign country either. I am curious to here from those more privileged enough than me to have experienced different cultures of various countries. Could you kindly add your opinions and experiences? It would be very helpful for me. Thanks!","Indians who have lived or are living abroad, few questions about your social life for you",AskIndia," Just wanted to say that it takes a few years to accept a foreign country as one’s own. For me, it took about 4 years to feel more at home in the US than India. Regarding citizenship, I prefer a world without any borders, and so I don’t really care about it. For convenience, I will apply for citizenship next year.

I haven’t faced any racism *ever* in the US over my race. I have however met some Indian people who automatically started talking about me being a South Indian (so you eat curd rice everyday?) lol. I don’t get why North Indians look down on South Indians.. like.. I don’t even care that you are from North India and whatever you say about South India isn’t going to matter to me, so it’s pathetic to try. Yea, depends on the effort you put in. Most people don't care as long as you are polite and friendly. You will also come across some class A assholes. It's better when you make an effort to learn the local language. And don't be a creep. There is a lot of variation depending on where you go abroad and even within the countries abroad. For example in the US and UK, there are large desi population centers in the big cities. So here is my personal experience :

Dating : really easy if you are open to non Indians. Also easy if you are in larger countries with Indian diaspora if you want to date Indians. Harder if you are looking for specific caste/ gotra and are more conservative in general.

Social life : really depends on the city or location. Way better than tier 2 cities in India. A bit harder than Mumbai/Bangalore - Hard for the first year or two until you get the right set of friends.

Community: Rather harder to answer. 

I have always felt very accepted in the US. Never faced racism in the US - but I am in the high tech west coast bubble. 

A lot of Indians form little Indian communities in countries with larger diaspora. These interactions could be rather deep but limited due to small size of the community. 

I actually have a pretty good time with my non Indian friends. We are pretty close. A peculiar one here is the formality of visits (very planned). I miss the random “show up at the drop of a hat with a buddy in tow” kind of visits that are common in India. Honestly, all of the answers to this depend on you, as a person. Like, I've lived in a foreign country, and it really doesn't do much for your social life, if you yourself tend to not want to be in social situations for whatever reason. The onus is going to be on you to go out and socialize (or maybe not go out, bc y'know, pandemic and all).

But really though, you kind of have to go put yourself there without fear, in order to be welcomed and accepted. You really can't wait for them to invite you on a consistent way, and this is true for any place.

With dating...I hate to say it, but yes, there is a prejudice. People won't like having to hear that though, bc it will never be an overt sort of prejudice, as in no one will ever come out and say to you that you're ugly bc you're Indian, etc. But it is there. It is definitely there on dating apps. I've talked to a few of my non-white friends abroad, and they all definitely get much less interest from people compared to white people. Again, people are going to disagree with me here on this, but it's there. On the other hand, don't let this stuff get you down. You probably won't really notice it, until you do.

Social life, I really don't know. I'm not much of a person for just hanging out in pubs and stuff like that, but from what I can tell, it's definitely much easier bc there are places for you to go and hang out that isn't just your house or someone else's house. 

Wrt your questions about community...again, the answers to these depend entirely on you. It depends on who you are finding to interact with, who you have around you, etc. And in this, the case for me has been the same abroad as it has been in India. I've found shallow people and had shallow interactions in both places, and also had the fortune of making some really deep connections with people in both places. If you want to find that, you will, it doesn't matter where you really are. 

With racism, what I've found, with most Indians though, is that many of them are really bad at recognizing when they're being treated in a racist way, bc they don't really have much knowledge or understanding of how racism in places like America manifests itself. People have this idea of racism in their minds where they think it's stuff like how it used to be during British colonial times--getting thrown out of trains, overt policies for not promoting Indians, etc.

Those types of things don't happen, and on the surface of it, Indians are very taken by how people abroad are nice, bc they speak politely, say thank you, smile, etc. But the same people who do that are the sorts of people who joke about how foreign students are only accepted into American universities bc we pay higher tuition, not bc we score well. They're the people who want to date you bc they think you're ""exotic"", which isn't the compliment people think it is. Those things don't seem like they're racist or prejudiced on the surface, unless you've spent enough time to see through to the other end, and you realize that the people who make those tuition jokes don't take your skills seriously bc of their preconceived ideas, or that you're not being respected by the people who go out with you bc they think you're ""exotic."" 

And even when they realize, they kind of just excuse it bc, ""At least it's not like it is at home. In India, everything is worse."" I'm not disagreeing with this sentiment either, btw. But there are a lot of problems iwth any place outside of India you'll want to move to, tbh, it's just a matter of how seriously you decide those issues will affect you. For most Indians, the prospect of leaving the country for greener pastures is enough, that they'll excuse most other things. Again, not disagreeing with that exactly, just saying that that's how people often see it. Community - Really depends on where you live. Most places have an Indian presence but some have a bigger Indian presence. If you're someone who finds comfort in it, you should move to areas like this. Eg - Seattle, California, NJ. Depending upon your situation, you could make friends across ethnicities. Easier when you're a student - you can be roommates together, be group partners, etc. A little harder when you're at work - but this is probably more of a personality thing

Social - Massively. Freedom of staying by yourself, freedom of traveling by yourself SAFELY has definitely step up my social game!

Dating - Sucks. But, that might be just me, others probably have better luck than me."

I hope I am wrong, but let’s check back after a year.",Prediction: Modi government will pawn India’s gold reserves,Policy/Economy," I didn't get how you reached that prediction. I mean the RBI reserves is brimming, with India having an import cover of 9 months or so , and yeah, even though it seems anything can happen in this government, which apparently everyone will somehow justify and support, we don't have a BoP crisis in our hands. Lol, just a while back it was being wondered that we may current account surplus for the year, so from going that to a BoP crisis, is a bit of a stretch unless I am overlooking something. Also look at Congress role into not passing Yashwant Sinha's budget, leading to a downgrade in credit rating, which made the crisis worse.

Edit: I thought I should add this. India( and other countries may have to face a situation like 2013( taper tantrum) , but India at least now, looks good shape Or there will be party infighting and splinter “What's bad for the hive, is bad for the bee” - Marcus Aurelius

That's an annual affair. This year's is larger than usual due to OMO and forex operation RBI has been doing all year

> I hope I am wrong, but let’s check back after a year.

Yeah, 'Pawning' gold reserve was a fix to a totally different problem

All govt. will do is step up the disinvestment pace and let inflation run a bit high for a couple of years while keeping interest rates low and thats it.

Please refrain from baseless conspiracy theories and lower the level of discourse here Do you know that Rajiv Gandhi, a Congress party man was PM from 1984 to 1989? Do you know his policies were instrumental in creating the economic crisis you are discussing? It is even mentioned in the Wiki link you have shared.  It didn't ""require"" congress to come and do some magic. The crisis was of Congress's making and it took the courage of PVNR to take India out of the mess. Another: They will be re-elected to power with at least 300+ seats in 2024. They re really fcuking things up for us but not the way you saying. The forex reserves include everything including physical gold assests. Now, the reserve bank is a bunch of super-competent bankers who are doing the best possible assest management. But the government is eyeing all their profits so they have masterfully increased the cheque they withdraw from rbi every year. I am leaving many details here as it is will be a very long post. But i don’t understand what is this mess u talking about that BJP created before 1991 and congress fixed it later. Can you explain these chain of events for me?

For such small amounts, keep the amounts on an exchange. First congrats, investing long term at a young age is fantastic  

Second, please do not invest in cryptocurrency. There is no regulation; it is highly volatile and subject to all sorts of fraud. 

Third, look for index funds ( passive funds) or ETF. The cost of ETF is higher than index funds. 

Try the Investment Subreddit here. 

Even better, learn about investment yourself. There are different strategies and philosophies of investing. 

It's not that you shouldn't take risks, especially since you are thinking of investing so early, but those risks should be strategic and calculated. That requires more information & understanding.

But yes, if you want to invest with a long term horizon, I would suggest passive investing ( index funds), then once you understand the nuts and bolts of investing, take calculated risks.

They could've issued a challan. It really boils my blood to see these rowdies behaving like animals. If lathi charging and abusive language is needed to enforce law then may God help us. This needs to stop. This level of misuse of power is where the most corruption breeds in our country. SHAME. PLEASE STAND AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY.,When will India rise against Police brutality?,Law & Courts," Never. We can’t even vote for the right people. Our current leadership had a laundry list of fuck ups and yet the phuddu unkills and aunties voted for the same incompetent, illiterate fascists scum. If we can’t even vote for the decent people and go against our own self interests then standing up against police brutality is a thing too far. It's a real issue and I've been thinking about this for a while now.
I think we should start by 1) Significantly increasing the salary of cops and 2) Training them a lot more.

Police have the lowest salaries in the government sector, and that's one of the reasons they do terrible Jobs; you get what you pay for. We need to pay them more so that they are less likely to accepts bribes and take their jobs more seriously. It might also attract a better class of men and women as a career. 

Police should ideally spend AT LEAST 1/4th of their on duty time training. Train them constantly; not just physical training, but sensitivity training. Train them to take more responsibility, and act more humanely. To actually put them in a mindstate where they see themselves as helpers to the public, and not just as some sort of brute enforcers.

Most people hate police and see them as criminals anyway, we need to show the cops that they can do better, and that we support them...as long as both parties are willing to make the effort to end this festival of debauchery and thuggery. bhai literal criminals hai power me, police to wardi wale gundey hi hai, like ppl literally ni matter what their political spectrum unanimously agree that police are corrupt and vile creatures still nothing changes... Never. We can't even get rid of corporal punishment in schools. Lol. In the custody, police beat your private parts and may even insert the stick in private parts.

If you die, police doctor will give a generous death by heart attack certificate, case closed.

If there is huge protest covered by media, one of the errant police will be suspended(paid vacation) till your case hogs limelight, after that investigation done by a police team (who were most likely involved in the crime), will give suspended police clean chit, he will come back, garlanded, may even get promoted.

BJ Pee gobarment can easily pass a police reform bill to make torture a non bailable offense and police has to prove them innocent if independent medical report finds signs of torture.

Ayega to Fodiji hi. (20000 crore palace enjoy kar ne ke liye aur TV mein crocodile tears bahane ke liye) From my point of view this is lack of sufficient planning in recruiting honest and decent officer by centeral governments both congress and bjp. States government as well for state level post. Most of the government forces are under control of Indian civil servants. 

A general think I notice in government officers is their entitlement and lack of responsibility this is at all levels but only good leaders can make change.

Government is to serve people even a ias officer should go out of his way to provide service to a illerate villager sadly all we have is entitled officer who in turn bread more entitled officers.

With good leadership and guidance and with proper training this can be changed I believe so.

Government should represent people from all walks of life like Dalits tribal people and people from villages etc. We are a country that believes we need a dictator to fix what is wrong with our nation. Why police brutality continues is anybody's guess at this point. When there is enough police. Indian police is hopelessly overstretched. yeah moral policing is really bad We are voting for fascists but don't want them to do fascism. We first have to vote out BJP from power then gradually police reforms will occur. FUCK THE POLICE!"

The data currently available online shouldn't hurt many people but it's still worrysome. Phone number, name, email address and most importantly Addrees. India need stricter PII laws. Something like GDPR in the EU.

The hacker hasn't shared the payment details but from what I understand they intend to share it with the person who's willing to buy the data. Making it online is just a Proof of Concept. Many companies would even be willing to pay for this data.


Edit: Typo Yep the data is leaked. I have the link but I am not posting it anywhere to discourage this sort of stuff. Most important details leaked are

emails
Phone numbers
Addresses
Total amount spent on Domino's orders.

This is big. Where can we check if our data was compromised in the leak? I read an article about this today morning. So, the data breach is not recent, it happened maybe a couple of months ago. The hackers had then asked for a ransom of 10 BTC. But Domino's gave a statement:
""So mostly daata contains buyers orders,. Phone number, emails which has not much relevance for our  future business.""
What they didn't tell that hackers also had your address and longitude and latitudes exact to 10 metres.
After this statement, hackers made the link, and here we are.

For all those whose data has been leaked, if it contained your mail and/or credit card details, kindly change them. Before the data was not accessible by others, but now its public. And before you ask, no I will not be sharing the link. Hi

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/india) if you have any questions or concerns.* Very well written 👏👏 Per ye government to sab kuch bechney k chakkar me hai It's much simpler than that I think. Honestly the class narrative works the other way since it's mostly the English speaking urban elite who use Unilever products in FMCG. The rest of India has been forever using these 'ayurvedic' branded products. It just used to be Dabur and the like before and Patanjali added a religious branding element and took over that market. This trend has been there for years. Patanjali was a dramatic growth story even during the UPA era so I'd say your hypothesis is a bit conspiratorial.

Most of this stems largely from ignorance, lack of scientific temperament, really poor understanding of how modern science and quality control works and companies like Unilever and Nestle being highly exploitative cheating companies when they were absolute monopolies in India. 

To a lot of Indians Ayurveda as a concept is much easier to understand and it's absolute claims of being able to cure anything is much easier and intuitive to grasp than the the more careful statistical statements of efficacy made by genuine product testing. Indian companies have better managed to use marketing to grasp hold of the non upper middle class market better than Unilever ever did. Unfortunately that demographic is suspicious of actual medicine (allopathy ain't a thing bro) and trust anything as long as it is ayurvedic.

This isn't new or even unique to India. It's a common human trait called naturalistic fallacy. Things that seem 'man made' automatically are seen as less credulous than 'natural' products. Even though both went through a rigorous manufacturing process."

These are the dangers of Quacks promoting their unproven “formulations” as medicines for diseases, especially novel diseases because modern medicine tries to continually evolve with the new evidence being provided everyday. There’s a reason modern medicine is successful today and it is the scientific process. Experiment a way to control a disease and if it doesn’t work accept it and try to formulate a better treatment protocol. This is how the scientific process works and when there’s a new disease, we don’t know how to treat it immediately. We try the various drugs and protocols at our disposal and if that doesn’t work try to move on to better ones. This may look unscientific and counter intuitive, but this process has worked for decades now and will continue to work for decades to come, because that is how science works. 

Even from the beginning of this pandemic, any country that has followed the scientific process and advices of doctors,epidemiologists and scientists has done well and every populist anti intellectual leader(read Trump, Bolsanaro, He who must not be named to avoid sedition, UAPA, NSA) has made their country suffer because of their stupidity. Call me callous, but I'm hoping lots and lots of people, including the rich, stay at home or go to treatment centers, and leave the nice allopathic hospitals, doctors and vaccines to us. Let them take coronil, atleast let the ones who ask get the actual medicine Ram Kishan Yadav is a chu How do you escape from this when the freakin' UNION HEALTH MINISTER himself launches this with fan fair! Let them sign an agreement of responsibility and give them coronil. Sometimes hands need to burn to stop playing with fire. And he should be prosecuted to the maximum extent for spreading rumours and nonsense!!"

njk3zk,Something entered my ears rn I can feel it moving around ny eardrums please suggest something I need help quick,Some insect just entered my fucking earssss help seriously,AskIndia," Relax, don't panic... It is a discomfort, it won't affect your eardrum. Show light through your ear opening. It might just come out. If you can wait then wait. If it is too bothersome, take a dropper and put water inside your ear. Make sure you don't put oil, that way it could get stuck and will not be able to come out on its own.

Edit: Added first option as wait and watch. This exact same thing happened to me. Just buy a syringe without a needle, buy a big one. Fill it with water, and put it to your ear, and squeeze fast, for me it took only one go and it just came out with the water. Before this, it kept buzzing and nothing was visible. Go to an ENT specialist as soon as possible. 
Anything you do will only make their job harder. 
I know the treatment but since I’m not an ENT specialist I won’t be giving advise on their behalf. 

Don’t change a simple out patient procedure into a surgical one by self medicating Get it checked by an ENT immediately if it is not visible by shining light in your ear canal. u/sharanyaaaaa Have you been diagnosed as COVID-19 positive? Or, been inoculated to fight the SARS-2 virus? Some related studies suggest possible relations with tinnitus, e.g.,

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14992027.2021.1896793 use a strong light source to attract it outside of your ear Ask a family member to use a small tweezer to take it out. May be a worst idea. I don't want to share but here you go. Before you try this, i just want to confirm if it's not your imagination. Some people can hear buzzing noise because of tinnitus. If you are sure about insect then go ahead and try only once.

will insect die of dettol?

If so dip ear buds in dettol and apply inside your ear. Remember Don't pour dettol you may injure your ears. Just use ear buds and apply. It may give you burning sensation. Hope the insect dies.

Also don't push the ear buds too deep."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/india) if you have any questions or concerns.* ""The number of Covid-19 cases in India has just crossed the 25-million or the 2.5 crore mark. That is a 16 million (1.6 crore) increase from November 23 — the date from which the government said it would do the genome sequencing of five per cent of positive cases.

Which means that by now, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortium (INSACOG) should have sequenced 800,000 (or 8 lakh) genomes of the virus. A May 6 press statement of the Department of Biotechnology said that, so far, about 20,000 samples had been sequenced.""

""The pandemic hit the country so severely in March 2020 that the government had to declare a national lockdown. Yet, it was not until December that the government announced the consortium for genetic sequencing. INSACOG was launched on December 30 last year, a good 11 months after the first case occurred in India.

Even then, things do not appear to have gone on smoothly. For example, INSACOG asked for Rs 100 crore; but it was not until March that any funding arrived and it received Rs 70 crore.""

""It is clear now that the 5 per cent target is highly unlikely to be achieved ever, because of the rising number of cases. The ‘5 per cent’ was not randomly chosen; it is the minimum .required to keep track of the virus variants. Today, the active cases are rising at about 1.2 lakh a day. Five per cent of it is 6,000 samples. Going by the data provided by the government in its December 22 note, the ten laboratories together have a capacity to sequence about 30,000 samples a month, or 1,000 a day—six times less than what is needed to meet the target.""

""The work was hampered by the unintended consequence of the government’s ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’ order of May 2020, which banned imports of goods worth less than Rs 200 crore to promote local procurement. Genome sequencing requires some imported material and, so, the entire effort of genome sequencing slowed down. Even after the government exempted items needed for genome sequencing from the ambit of the scheme, some special plastics inadvertently remained within the import ban.""

""The poor progress in genome sequencing also affects India’s image abroad, as all countries are required to upload data into a common global repository, called the ‘Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza data’, or GISAID. This is to alert the world about new mutants.""

""How much of India’s data has been put into the pool is not known, but the May 6 note said “50 per cent of the data has been uploaded in GISAID”. Since the samples sequenced were “about 20,000”, only about 10,000 have been put into GISAID. As a percentage of the total number of cases in India so far—25 million—this is a miniscule 0.004 per cent.

The world is moving towards ‘next generation sequencing’, or NGS. There are several NGS platforms, but the common feature is that they analyse thousands of bits of DNA chains simultaneously. The process is faster by orders of magnitude. NGS is an important tool in disease control and origin tracing. At such a time, India seems to be a laggard.""

And also the one anti-Modi episode of Last week tonight is not available Yes. They censor content.
Some titles have full frontal nudity and its fine and present, but some titles have language and nudity cut out. Prime India does more censoring tho.

In prime, you can easily find it out by comparing the runtime with IMDb but you can't even do that with hotstar because they speed up most titles 5 percent.
So, about 5-6 mins will be missing from a 2 hour movie.
Its not missing per se, just because of the sped up playback. So, you can't even compare it with IMDb without doing some basic math 😂 They do. Whosoever knows great shows underrated too on Disney+Hotstar please share.

Trying to sell it but to no avail.,AskIndia," Just say you found a note left by ghost that he is leaving Get it renovated. Explain neighbors not to as advertise negatively as it would bring their property prices down as well That's one of the market tactics to crash the cost of property. 

Put it on rent for a while. It will develop confidence among neighbors. If it’s the neighbors and you need not sell it immediately get a some fake baba and show the neighbors you are having something to remove the ghost . Later spread the news that the baba told entire building is haunted and the epicenter is your neighbors house. Also ensure to have the milkman , newspaper bubble it to them that their apartments market value is diminished and they need to control it .In the meanwhile get someone to rent your apartment if required at a lower than market rent.
It would become your neighbors headache to prove the building and apartment are no longer haunted . 

Seems petty but with petty neighbors need petty stuff Shouldn't you also consider what the ghost of the previous tenant would like to sell it for? Taking such a decision all by yourself is frankly selfish. Trust me, you don't want to get caught up with legal issues once the property is sold at a price thats not conducive to both sellers. Sell it silently. Try to not let them know. That's what my neighbor did and there actually was a family suicide in that house. Renovate then pretend the people coming over are guests. Keep it as hushed as possible I think you should perform a very public exorcism, and then create a certificate stating that the ghost has been removed from the premises.

Just make a lot of noise by banging a bunch of pots and pans together, light some incense, yell a lot of chants and make sure there is an audience. Add some special effects too, if you can. Give it out in rent first.

After a few months when you sell. You can use Tennant references well good for the buyer and bad for the seller :/"

njrdco,"Addressing History and SPL first:

It’s illogical how the usual emphasis is only about modern history (British Raj period) and the Mughal empire.

Like this content spans the entirety of 7th grade, 8th grade, and parts of 9th and 10th grades.

There is haaardly anything about the Maratha Kings, the Sikh empire, the 3-4 major South Indian empires and how influential they were in maritime geopolitics of the Indian Ocean and South East Asia (even today there’s Hindu architecture and culture in SEA countries, something that I was oblivious to all throughout my school years). 

Also, the fact that Nazism, Russian Revolution, and Nationalism in Europe (9th and 10th syllabi) are all taught without building a prior base in the two World Wars. And absolutely no mention of the Cold War and how WW3 almost happened.

(No Cold War but there was a chapter on Vietnam War!? RIPLogic)

These topics are some of the most important parts of recent History. And hardly any direct discussions on them???

Speaking of SPL now...
How do they not give a thorough explanation about leftist, rightist, and centrist ideologies? Like something similar to the political compass needs to be addressed. How do they teach  case-studies about radicalism, nationalism, capitalism, communism, aristocracies, and dictatorships without that basic understanding of the political spectrum?

In modern Indian history, there is hardly anything about how the Indian Left (INC) was heavily influential in driving the British out, rather than the Right. We end up believing that there is no such bifurcation as left-wing secularism and right-wing nationalism, and that all freedom fighters had the same ideologies to construct the New India with.

Hardly anything about how Marxism and Maoism have influenced certain parts of India. Nothing about some Indian leaders who were well established with the Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.

No clarity on why Gandhiji was assassinated. No clarity about Indo-Pakistani communal violence, post-Independence. No clarity on one of the largest mass-migrations in History, between India and Pakistan, post-colonialism.

Looking back, I feel that the British rule and the Mughal conquerors were heavily glorified...

Is it just me, or do y’all feel it too? That the current Social Sciences textbooks need to be purged into oblivion and replaced with a new syllabus, carefully revised and updated to meet the modern standards without much biases?

My cousins from the USA were being taught about the World Wars in 7th grade while we were still sucking up to “the Genocidal Adventures of Mohammad Bin Thuglaq” 🙄 oh wait, there was nothing about “sEcULaR” Mughal rulers genociding millions of Indian people... was there?

The historical biases are so extreme, it hurts to even acknowledge it.

—————————————————

Addressing Biology and Physics:

I might as well slip in the problem with Biology and Physics textbooks... there’s wayyyyyy too less numerical problems in physics and it’s difficult to adjust to the 11th grade problem-oriented physics suddenly after 10th. Also I feel like astronomy and cosmology should be introduced from the beginning of high-school, because were advancing into an inter-planetary civilisation in the near future and why keep the youngins out of touch with the pace of modern space-races? Astronomy and cosmology are mind-blowing subjects... it would be an amazing thing to create interest in the marvels of the Cosmos, among young kids!

And biology sucks big time. Nothing is really up to date with all the scientific developments as of late—I’m talking about emphasis on genetic engineering, CRISPR tech, etc. I’d call for an obligatory chapter on Pandemic management as well, seeing how disastrous it can be in a country THIS populous and run by a government that has mismanaged the situation. And the statistical data of other existing chpaters is largely outdated.

(Speaking as a med-student, even the medical textbooks need some revisionist ideas, I feel. There’s so much casual homophobia and transphobia that feels outdated 🤷🏽‍♀️)",The problem with NCERT textbooks... (or is it just me?),Non-Political," I think history book gives detail about mughal and british empire is to give students a sense of akhand bharat chutiyapa. Like we were always united. To let student see bharat existed always and to install sense of nationalism. 

China does it too. Every china kid think china as a political entity exist since god created this universe When I was in school it annoyed me that history books were filled with north indian history with barely a footnote for any other part of the country The same problem lies with ICSE. Too much facts, not enough content. Not enough geopolitical nuance, no world history, no economics context, who remembers how many tons a particular temple weighs, and how is it helping you today? Sadly, you are suffering from the misapprehension/delusion that education is designed to create critically thinking, well-informed citizens of the world. No No, it's exactly the opposite. It is to create obedient cogs that power the factories to greater production levels and keep the economy chugging along while allowing the elites to maintain a stranglehold on power, without question. My compliments to you for identifying the obvious inconsistencies in the textbooks that the students are forced to memorize by rote-learning, on the pain of not getting a good 'job'. You know, so one can then have a family and have children, and then perpetuate the cycle all over again. This is why people vote for Gobhis like Modi (and, Gandhis), cause it's too hard of a job to critically analyze the depravities of a man known for Godhra. Good times for the plutocrats, hard times for the proles, as always.

Education is the first act of state-mandated mass brainwashing, more of the same follows through life. Even Bill Wurtz's 19 min long ""History of the entire world, I guess"" has more info than our social textbooks. What is frustrating me is that half of the chapters were not taught to us since it was not in the portions. Not even a slight mention in the classes All your concerns are valid, and you can include all this and more in history textbooks but at the end, kids will have to just rote learn facts and vomit it out on paper, it's not as if they teach you history so you can learn something from it. The kids will eventually end up hating studying history even more. NCERT glorifies the Delhi Sultanate and Mughals. Stupid piece of shit. There really wasn’t much about Ancient India. Marathas too minor to merit much space on ncert I feel. ~ 100 years and regional empire. Meh. 

And why not glorify mughal empire:
1. Admin set up exported across the world
2. South Asia considered global leader at the time. 
3. Very famous monuments creates

And why not glorify British Raj:
1. Abolished Sati
2. Education
3. Basic rights
4. First time logicless casteism etc not given any bhav

Let's be honest, without the Brits, we would have:
1. Rule based on manusmriti (blech)
2. No education worth anything (only brahmins would learn Vedas and ayurveda)
3. Women would be owned by husbands which in joint families means all men are services by bahu
4. We wouldn't even know any better

When India became independent, some ""leaders"" did try to form new govt based on this. Why do you think Jinnah left? 

Thankfully, Gandhi sometimes listened to others and people like Ambedkar, Periyar and Nehru existed."

There are multiple incidents across India where cops would rather use force or unwarranted violence to deal with situations and people. 

Keeping aside the repeat offenders. Why can’t police be a little fucking emphatic to commoner and not try to take their frustrations out every chance they get. Because the same cops behave like puppy dogs when the other party is either rich or powerful or both.

They are there to protect the elites, not the petty citizens. They hate working, as anyone else, but have a badge, authority, and guns to stave you off. There is also extremely limited oversight, and even lesser punishment. Unless, you are Ambani; then the wheels start rolling effortlessly. Encounter Killings, unreasonable violence, hafta collections, etc, that is what cops symbolize for 99% of people. You can't even file an FIR for a stolen phone without being bullied into making it 'lost', in order to keep down crime statistics. Really, it is time for a reorganization of cops, BLM-style. Defund the Police and replace them with community support services, with full public oversight. Except, we have no money nor any political will. So, fight together or suffer alone. My father told me about this story when i was kid in year 2008...we were sleeping on terrace, because of electricity outage, than he told me this story…  
  
He told me that my great grandfather used to work as clerk in district magistrate office. With fortune that district magistrate was brown indian, and not white British. Its rare because at that time civil service exam were used to be held in Britain rather than india, so that many British people could get employment in high position job in india, so indians have to travel to Britain to give the exam, so few indians were district collector at that time…those brown district collector who used to work under white British masters were given lots of respect from common brown indians,they were called collectors , because they used to collect tax from poor farmers with the help off local police…so these brown collector/other higher brown officials (brown sahib) started feeling that they are different from other common brown indians , and started being more harsh to common brown indians (farmers) than white masters themselves, they started copying their white masters either to impress them, or to feel equal. They started smoking cigarettes like white masters, dressing up like them. The same was case with other high position in which brown indians hold that position. White British masters heard of this. They started calling their brown subordinate as “baboon”, baboon is a type of brown ape who copies human action or other animal action. This became part of daily life. The word was even started to be used for clerks too by white masters, like “baboon bring that file"", “ baoon come here""…  
  
Common brown Indians who used to visit government offices for any work, used to hear this, white master calling their brown subordinate “baboon come here""…the common brown not knowing the meaning of the word used to think white master in love and affection used to call their brown subordinate as “babu""…yes ,common brown indian took “baboon"" as “ babu"", at that time people was not that literate. So in awe the common brown indian told his friends, family that how white master in affection use to call their brown subordinate (their brown sahibs) “babu"", friends also were impressed…the word spread like fire…people started calling their small kids, children as “babu"" in affection, and motivating them to become government officials, munshi, civil servants, so that they could get money, and work with white sahibs and get some love and affection from their white sahibs…government officials from then onwards were started to be called “babu"" in respect and love, they were the highest position a brown common indian could ever reach, because having white skin was out of scope…when brown sahibs were asked by common brown indians what “babu"" means, brown sahib to save his face, used to sheepishly say “yes gore sahib (white master) call us babu in affection and love""….today also government officials are called babu in respect, and small kids, children are called babu by their family members in affection…. underpaid, underqualified, corruption. Most of them are drunk on power They are notorious for [demanding bribe](https://np.reddit.com/r/PassportIndia/comments/ld888n/corruption/) during passport verification They're all sweet and good as long as they're not engaged in their duties by you. The minute they have to do their duty, you can only see that they are only corrupt. 😒 Indian police officers don't come from other countries. Thet are us, with a bit of power. When will body cams become a requirement for police?

......and Dashboard Cams for all vehicles. The police in India date from the British Raj, where the goal was to cow the Indian populace.

We still have systems dating from that era, and those systems are the ones hurting the country. This is the culture of our country.
You can literally see this at your own house. If you have to make someone follow any rule, we know only to enforce it by force.
This is the problem.
The policeman doesn't know any other way to enforce a rule. They will beat you (especially teenagers), torture you or humiliate you.
There are many cases viral on twitter, where police brutality just because a person is out on road.

Also, don't generalise every other case by saying that the people deserve it as they are not following the lockdown rules. You don't know their story and circumstances.
And even if someone is not wearing a mask, how is it better to beat him black and blue (that too by unmasked policemen) rather than giving him a mask on the spot and making him wear it or 100 other options to help him. The police assholes and the state machinery have always thought they could beat this pandemic with a lathi. These are even bigger chutiyas than lala ramdev or terrorist thakur."

You could work on enhancing your skills while the lectures are on. I'm a commerce graduate but My major friends are engineers and they've done this throughout 2020. Anyways you can study in the last days and still excel. Vaise bhi half the time you guys can copy since everything is online.
And from this msg it feels like your first year is about to end. You anyways don't have to study the common subjects anymore. Just this semester has to pass. 
Quitting college and a startup feels fancy and needs real guts. If you think of working, there might be start ups which might take first year students, but big companies have a qualification criteria, which maybe after a few years of experience you might not need it, but majorly every good company has a qualification criteria. 
Plus if after a few years you feel like getting a formal education, like a masters you'd not even be eligible. 
I'm not trying to scare you, but for Indians to reach a level where they consider only skillset and not formal education is gonna take a little while. 
Also from my family's experience, if parents don't hold a graduation degree, kids are not admitted in good schools. No matter how big the family business is. You can switch to a cheaper college, but quitting isn't a very good choice Maybe join a cheaper college. 

And learn all those things? NO!

Every engineering student's life is same, yours is no different. Just suck it up and keep at it. Try to find interest in subjects and topics taught to you. It might help if you look at animated videos or youtube channels that can augment your knowledge on those topics. No. I saw a similar post here about some kid doing certification courses from Google Analytics and Jibble and their parent pushing the narrative that this is ""non-traditional"" education is somehow better. It isn't! Google Analytics certification isn't going to get you a job, it's a nice thing to have in addition to your degree.

Fact is jobs in India are tough to get even for engineers. If you decide to not get a degree it's going to get that much more difficult. The fact you don't have a degree will be used to pay you less too. Also, a lot MNCs like Amazon and all don't hire someone without a degree. The kind of jobs you get will never let you grow as a professional and pay will never be enough.

I'll give you an example. I interviewed this guy who was almost 40. He did not have a degree and was working at some kind of call centre. He had been working there for a long time and was leading his team. I guess, that's why the contractor thought he would be a good fit for us. But he wasn't. I asked him at a point why he wanted to change and he said his company was about to shut down. Honestly, I felt very bad for him, but there was nothing I could do."
njaeqm,"There have been numerous cases where DM and these hawaldars are beating commoners and venting out their frustration on innocent people.

My friend who is a businessman and also a social worker (for personal gains ) advised me the following things which will atleast prevent the police or DM from beating you the way it happened in Chattisgarh.

1. If you can afford , get a second hand Toyota Fortuner or ford endeavour car , put a small sticker of the ruling party of your state and roam around with some change of 100-500 cash.. Forget police beating , these guys won't even stop you . Fortuner and endy are signs of influential people in the eyes of administration. He was saying that many small time politicians who are living on rent purchase these cars as such cars do make connections at higher level.



2. For middle class guys , get a bentex heavy gold chain it will basically cost you below 2000 INR . Even if you are roaming in activa, the police will deal with you gently and will never ever manhandle you. This heavy gold chain is an indication that you are a uneducated  villager having huge tracts of  land around the city .  



3. Take any female member of your family if going out. When a lady is there ,these guys never manhandle unless you start getting aggresive.



If any one from the department is lurking around here, kindly add more points.",Beginners Guide to prevent police from manhandling you on street.,AskIndia," Please don't wear a thick gold chain on the street, unless you wanna get shot. \>get a second hand Toyota Fortuner or ford endeavour car

This is 100% true. I have so many friends who(or their family members) are involved in politics. They all have Fortuners. 1b. Keep a saffron scarf in your car, wrap it around your neck while driving

Not quite sure if OP meant this to be a sh*tpost or real, but the advice does make sense, except maybe for #2 (bentex heavy gold chain on an activa). Here is the trick , it only works if you are close to height of  6 foot.

Wear Khaki trouser you can wear any colour shirt or t-shirt.  I do it when I travel by train, if you don't get seat speak to TTR you get seat easily arranged. Some shops reserves bike or car parking for customers you will not be stopped or bothered by security if you park the bike or car. 
If you are in bike you will never be stopped.

Remember in difficult times wear Khaki trouser.

My only gripe is chaddi gang started to wear em.

I've been practicing this since 90s. I never once mis representated as policemen myself though. This feels like satire, but feels like Poe's law in action at the same time. Lmao, I was expecting some legal advice, but probably this is more effective. 
But there are also legal actions which you can pursue, but that is more on the side of aftermath. Just wrap a khes(cotton blanket) around and travel in a bullet. No one messes with these guys cause you never know if a desi katta is hidden underneath that shawl.

For reference see how Manoj Bajpayee does it : http://www.india-forums.com/bollywood/images/uploads/ZAF_gangs-of-wasseypur.jpg ""Chacha humare vidhayak hai"" - One line thats enough. In TG, just wear White and white clothes with sports shoes. 

And also have ruling party flag in front of the car

Additionally, if you have any connections at the hospital, court, and police, have their stickers on bikes & car.

I had an advocate sticker on my bike and I was never stopped by any police man., I'm skinny and not six feet height., 4. . Costume tip. A white kurta payjama with a tricolor gamcha around your shoulders. I have also seen that Police doesn't stop certain people on the basis of profession. I have traveled multiple times in my relative's car with advocate sticker and without one. The one with sticker has never been stopped till now..."

Desh jaye bhar mein, mujhe raaj karna hai apne 20000 crore ghar se Completely change the voting system and try my best to go after MPs and corrupt crooks in any public office Resign or completely delegate covid fight to someone else Build better education system. 1. I would invest in education, making quality education accessible for all of the masses.

2. Increase spending on healthcare infrastructure. And by that I mean I won't just boast on constructing new aiims hospitals, but make sure that public health clinics are made to function efficiently in every district. Employ doctors and nurses and give them good salaries so they work for me and not start their own clinics.

3. Provide incentives for the MSME sector to increase employment opportunities for the youth in rural areas.

4. Reduce defence expenditure, but invest in research and development of defence architecture/infrastructure, so that we won't have to rely on imports.

5. Open up agriculture markets for privatisation but make sure that MSP is made mandatory. Provide opportunities for community farming and ecological farming practices. 

6. Develop separate rail corridors for logistics and transportation. Bi-laning of existing railway lines. 

7. Make sure sanitation facilities do not require the use of manual scavengers.

8. Work towards creating an awareness about environmental issues. Plant more trees to grow forests and natural habitats, not disturb ecologically sensitive areas. Reduce use of single use plastic products. 

9. Invest in renewable energy technologies, wind farms, small scale hydro power projects, etc. Try to reduce dependence on conventional energy sources.

10. Try to inculcate discipline regarding hygiene and waste management among the populace. 

11. Redact Draconian laws like UAPA, NSA and make a public forum for criticism and suggestions from the people.

12. Separate the state from interfering with religious matters, but allow freedom of religion. 

Edit. 13. A very long shot, but try to make sure that everybody has access to a good shelter and people don't have to work for their survival but for their happiness and betterment.

There are more, but I can't think of anything else at the moment. 1. Learn acting.

Rest can be made up by either me or my IT cell. Make federalism great again.. Seriously get the shit together to ensure mass vaccination asap. Queue up booster doses. Deploy Critical Thinking orientation than Religious Thinking orientation. Pick the best bureaucrats, best scientists, best economists for critical thinking jobs. Totally abandon religious thinking.

nj7t76,"I just want to tell you guys about this, back in 2011-17 we had followed a CCE pattern. I went to a DPS and there as a part of CONTINUOUS evaluation they conducted a Tuesday test (One subject is tested every Tuesday). I cannot explain how helpful that was. Literally all we had to do was prepare for 2 chapters of a subject, two chapters that were completed that month. So when the term exams came and we had to prepare for the chapters covered in those three months, it was relatively easy because we studied the basics of each chapter. So the term exams were harder, tested our critical thinking skills, math problems were difficult because they expected us to use logic. We also had these activities that were in a way a learning experience because we were expected to research about something beyond what we already know. And there was no high stakes exam at the end of the year. Around 50-60% of our grade was dependent on what we did the whole year. One high stakes exam for 3 hours did not decide what we did for the whole year. Things changed when the BJP came back, they thrashed the entire CCE pattern that actually worked, at least for my school. They re-emphasised on a board exam, a three hour exam to determine how good the student was. And today, in the middle of the pandemic, when the entire world has gone back to internal assessments, India is still stuck, completely out of touch in its archaic method of assessment. Now in 12th grade, all we did the whole year comes down to this one exam, we have failed to develop any alternative means. In short - India's education system puts all its eggs in one basket, and the basket's importance is that high that the govt doesn't even care if the eggs themselves rot.

What is even more annoying is how India never had an education system but rather had an examination system. We take great pride in Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella but they became what they did in the US, they went to tech school where they learnt their tech skills but not the management acumen, they developed it in the US. For all my teachers who praised India's education system for its emphasis on kids needing to study 24x7, first off a big FUCK YOU, secondly if it was the best in the world, we'd have at least been competitive with China, not like them, at least closer to China. Instead while their university professors are busy developing AI driverless trains and starting companies like Lenovo, our professors are busy being casteist and asking children to just study while the world around them collapses.

The fact that students in America, to get into their top schools, have to start non-profits that teaches them management, start fundraisers and clubs that encourage communication skills and lead to social change. Where they have to research papers. Where you had to play a sport that teaches you more than I can describe. For all of the Gender Studies majors America has, it also has the largest technological scape anywhere. That's because education there is gradual, done on a continuous and comprehensive evaluation, scientific inquiry with an emphasis of all round development, not just in personality but also, in terms of how they study. We can never, I repeat never change the country if the only resource we have in abundance - Human Resource, is left depressed, left fending for itself, told by teachers to just study despite all that's happening, just asked to study and not talk politics, social justice, economic justice, just bullied by parents for even thinking of starting a start up, India can always only dream of matching the Chinese, forget the Americans.

Oh and Fuck you BJP, for asking me to waste another year of my life, probably deferring my admission at a foreign university because you incompetent semi literate idiots, believed in Ramdev Baba and not in science. Stfu, and make boards optional. Those kids who are applying to universities that require boards, ask them to write and those writing NEET, JEE, CLAT etc. may skip them because it doesn't make sense to risk your life for an exam that wouldn't even matter. For ex, if YogiBear wants to apply to DU and DU says go write boards, let YogiBear write boards. Like in US, where SAT was made optional. Sometimes common sense decisions help, but anyways I don't expect you to take educated decisions because you are the party that gave us, the list is simply too big.....",Rant on India's education system,Politics," What can you expect from the Education System, when its own education minister has 2 Fake Degrees and still is the education minister? Also according to him, astrology>>>>Science. 

Also 12th students are literally treated like robots. Teachers and parents expect them to study everytime. I totally hate this Boards concept. It really doesn't affect anyone's career. Elon Musk is not an idiot that he offers you a job without college degree at Tesla. He knows that degrees doesn't define anything. It is the knowledge and concepts that actually matter. Even Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are college dropouts but still ended up revolutionizing Computers and Mobile Phones. 

Our Education System only tests student's memory rather than their knowledge. This is one of the main reason why India hasn't produced any genius of Gates', Musk's or Jobs' level. We have only produced IIT Graduates like Sundar Pichai or an MIT (Manipal) Graduates like Satya Nadella, who instead of revolutionizing India chose to work for American Multi-Million Tech companies because they know that India is shit and will never revolutionize. How many people know the Bansal Brothers, the founder of Flipkart or Ritesh Agarwal, the Founder of Oyo? It is because our society takes pride in those who get selected in the top institutes like IIT's, NIT's etc. Although CCE pattern barely worked in average local schools because limited resources, dude do you really think they care. India has the largest no of geny and genz and the older people don't care. they are just looking for their own good and their families ofc but passing down shitty ideologies and they refuse to learn ffs.   

and again if they wanted to they could've handled the situation for final year and 12 graders with a little effort but they were too busy watching ramayan and banging thalis ffs. I am student right now in ICSE class 2021-22. The geography textbook literally has Air Sahara, Air Deccan and Jet Airways as examples for private airlines. And then it says - revised for 2022. Half of the information is outdated. For economics, we have to mug up all the points and simply understanding the concept isn't enough. The tenth grade board exams add nothing of value to students. The new 'NEP' seems to be revolutionary but don't know how it will be implemented. It also has many loopholes.

Btw in China too people give a very hard exam. There are coaching centres there too. Read about it. It's exactly like Indian exams, where you have to memorise a lot. Maybe it is the content of the exams which is the difference?"

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/india) if you have any questions or concerns.* >Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal talks to The Indian Express on the government’s handling of the pandemic, the role of the Opposition and the judiciary’s response to Covid-related issues. Excerpts:  
  
The country is reeling under the impact of the second wave of the pandemic. How has the judiciary responded in your view?  
  
The problem that we face in this country today is that the battle in court between the citizen and the state is perceived to be and often is an unequal battle. In that context, the decisions of the Supreme Court in the recent past suggest insufficient scrutiny of the position the State takes before the court. I will give you an example. If the government tells the court that there are no migrants on the streets contrary to the images for all to see, should the court not question the government? Clearly such a statement was contrary to heartbreaking images in the public domain of which we had knowledge. When migrants were stranded in various parts of the country, we saw images of the public supplying food and shelter to hapless migrants. The government’s position before court that all was normal, everything was being handled effectively by the state and that the migrant’s needs were being looked after was clearly untenable. The reality was contrary to what the nation witnessed; contrary to the reality on the ground? Yet the court chose not to scrutinise the reality. When this happens and the court takes for granted what the State states then the battle becomes unequal. That seems to be the heart of the problem in the processes of judicial determination of issues. This unequal battle cannot even be compensated by the indigent and the hapless hiring lawyers. Public interest litigation is the consequence. (With) occasionally absent quality legal representation, the battle becomes even more unequal. With the second wave, which has caused unimaginable devastation, unnecessary loss of human lives because of lack of basic facilities in our health infrastructure, and for other reasons, the judiciary has become far more sensitive to the prevailing and continuing human tragedy and has rightly become proactive.  
  
Many of the High Courts have been much more proactive.  
  
Because the pandemic is touching almost every family. The Chief Justice of India said the other day that a large number of members of the judiciary had themselves been affected. Now that it is affecting all of us…the virus doesn’t discriminate between the rich and the poor, the mighty and the weak…Courts have rightly started questioning the claims of the government. We are all moved to shame to witness the tragedy unfolding before our eyes; the power of social media has opened our eyes to institutional mismanagement and the callousness of some. Floating of dead bodies, absence of adequate supply of vaccines, shortage of beds, of oxygen, and then, of course, people profiteering in the midst of this crisis are matters of deep anguish. In this process, people have become “atmanirbhar” because the state is nowhere to be seen. That was certainly not the dream of the Prime Minister when he wanted an “atmanirbhar Bharat”.  
  
The Congress has a big pantheon of lawyers, you included….why didn’t the Congress think of knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court?  
  
Political parties should not get into this blame game in courts. That gives this human tragedy a political colour. I don't think courts should be turned into arenas for ventilating our political grievances. I think this should be done by lawyers, purely as lawyers, unrelated to the ideology they espouse.  
  
The Congress also does not seem to be able to make a point at the electoral arena. What is the way out then?  
  
You are sort of slowly persuading me to comment on elections which I am loath to do at this point in time...we are facing a national emergency and we must deal with that first before we deal with anything else.  
  
And how do you see the role of the Opposition in this kind of a pandemic situation?  
  
We shouldn’t talk about the Opposition’s role or the government’s role. The absence of the State will naturally result in the Opposition making suggestions to the government as to what should be done in the months ahead to protect our people. Such constructive steps should be welcomed. The real problem we are facing today is absence of adequate supply of vaccines; also absence of adequate production facilities. Why did we limit production of vaccines to two entities…both of them being private parties? Why was the public sector excluded from this? Why were international vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer, Moderna excluded? Why was the import of their vaccines not welcomed subject to approval? We need a massive national effort to ensure that we acquire the vaccines to vaccinate our adult population. Unless that is done, and that too quickly, we will be exposed to cataclysmic consequences exposing millions to this deathly second wave mutant virus...The fact is that we have not given enough support to our research community; not given enough funding to bio-tech researchers because we have a government that pays scant respect to the wonders of science. This government doesn’t encourage a scientific temper in our approach to issues. Prominent people within the ruling party, including ministers advise us to consume dark chocolate in these hours of uncertainty; appreciate the value of cow urine and cow dung…if we start believing in all this in the midst of a health crisis and the establishment supports such a mindset, we end up relying on tradition and belief than on science for effective outcomes. That is a mindset that needs to change.  
  
  
What is your suggestion for the government now?  
  
My suggestion for the government is to do what you can..which is to get our people vaccinated. Give all the money..the PM Cares fund, the Rs 35,000 crore you had set apart…spend it all. Negotiate with Pfizer and others. Even if you have to buy vaccines at higher prices, expensive…at whatever cost that is available after negotiation. Subsidise the people. The second issue is the virus has now reached the rural areas. There is no healthcare infrastructure at all to save them. The district administration should be asked to identify each family which has lost an earning member or a member of the family and provide support in terms of food, ration, medical aid. The government should forget all these projects which are controversial and start thinking of people rather than themselves. Frankly, if the government goes ahead with the Vista project…if they build it despite the pandemic, whichever alternative government comes to power must remove the plaque and say that this project was built despite the fact that money was needed to save people’s lives. That should be the plaque if this project is completed. It is an act of monumental insensitivity not to voluntarily stop this project... It's already happened and the whole world is witness. Scenes out of medieval battlefields. The 2024 elections are going to be very decisive. The damage our esteemed pm and his hitmen have caused us has put us on the path to a very tumultuous decade This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/if-govt-goes-ahead-with-central-vista-project-future-govt-must-remove-plaque-and-say-it-was-built-despite-money-needed-to-save-people-s-lives/ar-AAKh3EB?ocid=msedgntp) reduced by 92%.

nj9r6m,"The health minister tweeted today about his letter to Ramdev after his instigating comments on modern medicines - [first page](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2ExCbEUcAUefzT?format=jpg), [second page](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2ExCbEVgAEw8Pw?format=jpg).

Ignoring the fact that the minister never stated any personal disappointment from Ramdev's accusations, I want to highlight one point from his letter - diseases like small pox, ebola, SARS, and TB have all been controlled, treated, and eradicated by the modern medicines, and not from pseudo-science like any of those Ayush fields.

Consider the health status of India 100 years, or even 25-50 years ago. Diseases like TB, typhoid, jaundice, malaria, dengue were quite common, and used to wreck havoc across various regions regularly. Flu, plague epidemics were regular occurrences. India, and especially Kumbh melas have been the origin of multiple Cholera pandemics in the World. Malnutrition based diseases, like anaemia, goiter, were common among children, and they are common in many areas even now. In 1960s, child mortality rate was more than 1 in 5^[source](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT?end=2019&locations=IN&start=1960&view=chart) meaning 1 in 5 children died before reaching the age of 5. People used to die from diarrhea.

The one thing common in all of the above diseases is that none of them were controlled by the Ayurveda, Siddha, Homeopathy or any other jhaad-foonk. The only reason many diseases have been brought to control in India is the miracle of Modern medicine and all practices towards sanitation brought by it. Ayurveda with 'thousands of years of ancient wisdom' did absolutely nothing in eradicating or even controlling any of these diseases which have been prevalent for the entire history of humanity in India. Someone believing that it can prevent the disease caused by a virus, which Ayurveda system doesn't even know exists, is out of my understanding.",One true statement noted in Health Minister's letter to Ramdev,Science/Technology," Malaria and cholera. The major diseases of India don’t have victims these days due to  western medicine. 

Ayurveda May be good in some instances however it is not the panacea everyone claims it to be. [deleted] Great. Now all the people who already listened to him will not do stupid shit anymore.

The damage is done already. [removed]"
nifo3i,"Hello everyone,
Recently I graduated and got a job offer from a company. I have been offered two city choices, gift city and chennai. But I couldn't find any cons for gift city. I tried Quora and it wasn't helpful. So I thought posting here. So if anyone one of you are living in any of those cities and doing a corporate jobs , suggest which city should I go to. Both cities have high temperature, and I found , have almost same standard of living. 

Can anyone help in corporate view where should I go. 
Thanks in advance.",Advice for job location,AskIndia," No alcohol no meat Choose Chennai. Chennai is the better bet. Don't choose the city, choose the better job. I'd suggest you consider few things before making a decision:

Cost of living (includes rent, groceries, bills):

 Helpful because you'll get an idea how much you'll save every month

Safety:

 How safe the place is during the day and night (especially at night) because sometimes you might need to work late.

Distance from home:

Even if you need to live away from home choose a place which is closer to your home. So it'll be easier to travel back home during festivals, long weekends or emergencies. 

Miscellaneous:

This will include the places you visit when you're living in a new city, food you like/dislike, alcohol, clubbing and many more things.

Hope it'll help.

Also, Congratulations 🙌 These are the few things I looked for when choosing my job location in India, hopefully it will help you too:

* Proximity to parents. My parents are getting old and I wanted to make sure I was a 1 train/plane ride away from them.
* Proximity to a big city. Luckily I am from a metro city myself, so the point above and this one matched up. Why a metro city? Because I wanted to study further and do more courses and learn international languages while I was working. This would almost never work out in the comparatively smaller city my job was in pre internet age, actually I feel this will still not work out today.
* Weather. I did not want the weather I grew up in to be very different from the weather I was moving to.
* Cost of living. Smaller towns and cities generally have a lower cost of living, but also really bad public transport in India. I wanted to chose a city with a metro, at least the existence of buses and trains, unfortunately for me this was not possible.
* Cost of real estate. If I liked my job and wanted to stay there for ever, I wanted to know if real estate was going to be affordable when I wanted to buy one. Dont ever go to GIFT city( or for that matter dont go to Gujarat.) It is literally the most broing and lifeless place in the country. People there are thrash and you would be treated like an outsider. I say this because I worked in GiFT city and I decided to leave that shithole. The photos of GIFT city thay you see on the internet are just that. There is nothing in there. It is an absolute failure. And not just me , none of the people I know that came from outside the state liked the place( and I literally mean not one). Thats how pathetic the place is. Better go to Chennai. Whike the language issue might persist in Chennai, it is still 10X better than the hellhole that is Gandhinagar. And I am not even advising you not to go there, I am literally warning you. You would regret going there. MARK MY WORDS."

nlju75,"There is a metamorphosis that has been going in India for a long time since it's conception one can argue, of changing rights into privileges and then ending even those Privileges altogether, but now it's becoming more apparent. For example using Social Media when ever you want was a right for everyone in india pre 2013, then when GOI starting putting restrictions on social media in Kashmir, using social media when ever you want now became Applicable to ""everywhere in india but Kashmir"". So using social media was not now a right of people in india living outside of kashmir but a privilege because all people living in state of India couldn't access it( For example becoming president in Pakistan is a privilege of muslims not right of all pakistanis). Now there is news of twitter ban etc, so the privilege that ""everywhere in india but Kashmir"" had of using social media is in danger.  Same goes with other things like acts that give government rights to detain people for certain years before trails. These acts take right of habeas corpus of a  Kashmiri and of other people in India where they are present away thus making it a privilege in rest of india where habeas corpus  is still available. Now if people living in rest of india where habeas corpus is still available won't fight for those where it's not, soon their privilege will also be ended. Some other things are also are privilege in state of india for example A phone call, Calling services in Kashmir are regularly suspended during Eid etc.  making calling from a phone a privilege in all over india not a right(Note - During abolition of 370 they were banned for 2 weeks i guess and i saw the mothers weeping for children who were outside of kashmir and couldn't be contacted with, children crying because parents weren't home and no way to contact them). I just want to point out that the more indian people who have those privileges still available for time being let metamorphosis of rights to privilege happen by ignoring those whose rights were taken away from them. Their privileges wont last long.",Want to share something from a Kashmiri perspective on recent news of whatsapp ban.,Politics,
